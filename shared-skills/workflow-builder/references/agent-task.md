# Agent Task (`durable/run`)

Scope: the body shape for `call: durable/run` — the only agent-dispatch path in the system. Read this before adding an agent step. Source of truth: `src/lib/types/agent-graph.ts:65-80` (TS type) and the production fixtures in `scripts/fixtures/sample-workflows.json`.

## TL;DR

```json
{
  "summarize": {
    "call": "durable/run",
    "with": {
      "agentRef": { "id": "<agent.id>", "slug": "<agent.slug>" },
      "prompt": "${ \"Summarize this in two sentences: \" + .fetch.body }",
      "mode": "execute_direct",
      "maxTurns": 10,
      "workspaceRef": "local",
      "stopCondition": "Stop after producing the summary."
    }
  }
}
```

That's a complete, runnable agent step. The fields are explained below.

## Two equivalent `with` shapes

Both are accepted at runtime — the canvas marks the node `type: "agent"` based purely on `call === "durable/run"` (`isAgentTaskConfig` in `agent-graph.ts:401-407` is just that check).

**Flat** (preferred — what the simple browser-use template uses):

```json
{ "call": "durable/run", "with": { "agentRef": {...}, "prompt": "...", "mode": "execute_direct", ... } }
```

**Nested** (used by the office sample fixtures — wraps the agent body inside `with.body`):

```json
{
  "call": "durable/run",
  "with": {
    "body": { "agentRef": {...}, "prompt": "...", "overrides": { "maxTurns": 30 } },
    "mode": "execute_direct",
    "sandboxName": "${ .workspace_profile.sandboxName }",
    "workspaceRef": "${ .workspace_profile.workspaceRef }",
    "sandboxPolicy": { "keepAfterRun": true, "mode": "per-run", "template": "dapr-agent", "ttlSeconds": 7200 }
  }
}
```

When in doubt, use the flat shape. The `normalizeAgentTaskConfig` helper (`agent-graph.ts:409-453`) actually mirrors flat fields into a `body` field anyway, so both are interchangeable from the orchestrator's view.

## Body fields

From `AgentTaskBody` (`src/lib/types/agent-graph.ts:65-80`):

| Field | Required | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agentRef.id` | Recommended | `string` | The DB `agents.id`. Resolves to `agent-runtime-<agent.slug>` Dapr app-id. **Without this, the orchestrator falls back to legacy `dapr-agent-py` — almost certainly not what you want.** |
| `agentRef.version` | No | `number` | Pin a specific agent version. Defaults to current. |
| `prompt` | Yes | `string` | The appended user prompt to the agent. Use SW jq full-string interpolation for runtime values: `"${ \"Look at \" + .trigger.url }"`. Prompt Workbench Mustache placeholders are preview-only in V1 and are not substituted here at runtime. |
| `mode` | Yes | `"execute_direct"` | Literal enum value. Only mode supported today. |
| `maxTurns` | No | `number` | Default 50. Set lower for tight workflows; higher for complex multi-step agents. |
| `timeoutMinutes` | No | `number` | Per-execution timeout. Default 60. |
| `stopCondition` | No | `string` | Natural-language exit criterion the agent's stop hook checks. E.g. "Stop after the final response includes TASK COMPLETE." |
| `requireFileChanges` | No | `boolean` | If true, fail the run when the agent didn't modify any files. Useful for coding agents. |
| `workspaceRef` | No | `string` | `"local"` (per-call ephemeral), or a workspace ID, or `${ .workspace_profile.workspaceRef }` for sandbox bridging. |
| `sandboxName` | No | `string` | Override sandbox name. Used with `${ .workspace_profile.sandboxName }` for bridging. |
| `cwd` | No | `string` | Working directory inside the sandbox. Default `/sandbox`. |
| `agentRuntime` | Sometimes | `string` | Auto-derived from agentRef. Set explicitly for legacy slugs. |
| `agentGraph` | Auto-filled | `AgentGraphDefinition` | Custom decision graph (rarely set by hand). `normalizeAgentTaskConfig` injects a default. |
| `environmentRef` | No | `EnvironmentRef` | Override the environment (sandbox config). Default uses the agent's published environment. |
| `overrides` | No | `AgentOverrides` | Per-call overrides: `sandboxPolicy`, `tools`, `maxTurns`, `timeoutMinutes`, `cwd`. |
| `mcpServers` | No | `McpServer[]` | Per-call MCP server list. Can be direct endpoints or unresolved project references such as `{ "pieceName": "microsoft-outlook" }`. Layered on top of the agent's startup/project config. **Playwright stdio entries are auto-rewritten** — see below. |
| `hooks` | No | `HooksSettings` | Per-call hook config (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.). Per `docs/hooks-and-plugins.md`. |
| `plugins` | No | `string[]` | Plugin IDs to enable for this call. |

## How `agentRef.id` resolves to a pod

1. `with.agentRef.id` is the DB `agents.id`.
2. The session-spawn handler resolves to `agents.runtime_app_id` (set at agent-publish time by `src/lib/server/agents/registry-sync.ts`, which derives `agent-runtime-<slug>` from `agents.slug`).
3. The orchestrator yields `ctx.call_child_workflow("session_workflow", app_id="agent-runtime-<slug>", ...)`.
4. The Dapr placement service routes the child workflow to the per-agent pod.
5. The Kopf controller wakes the pod (scales 0→1) via the `agents.x-k8s.io/wake` annotation if needed.
6. Pod runs the turn, returns, scales back to 0 after `idleTtlSeconds` (default 1800).

If `agentRef.id` is missing OR resolves to an agent that hasn't been published, the orchestrator falls back to legacy `dapr-agent-py`. Don't rely on this — it's a backwards-compat shim.

## Prompt preview, templating, and cache

The workflow agent-node panel's `Compiled Prompt` preview uses the shared Prompt Workbench preview component. It should show:

- The selected agent/version/config hash.
- The canonical template name/hash when available.
- The rendered system message from the saved agent instruction bundle.
- The `chat_history` placeholder.
- This node's `prompt` as the appended user message.

Runtime interpolation inside `durable/run.with.prompt` is SW 1.0 jq only. Use `${ .trigger.<field> }`, `${ .previous_task.output }`, or concatenation inside a single full-string jq expression. A Mustache value such as `{{runtime.cwd}}` or `{{args.ticket}}` in the node prompt is an authoring preview warning, not a runtime variable, and will be sent literally unless another runtime layer handles it.

For prompt caching, keep volatile node/run data in the appended user message where possible. Avoid stamping cwd, sandbox name, session id, run id, or workflow input into the agent's stable system prompt or preset text unless model behavior truly depends on it.

## How to find a real `agentRef.id`

```bash
curl -s http://workflow-builder:3000/api/agents | jq '.[] | {id, slug, name}'
```

Or directly:

```sql
SELECT id, slug, name FROM agents WHERE is_archived = false ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

`/api/agents` filters out workflow-ephemeral agents (sessions created inline by `agentConfig` in a workflow, not user-published). Don't reference those — they don't have stable IDs.

## MCP servers (`mcpServers`)

Per-call MCP server config is layered on top of the agent's startup/project config. Read `references/mcp-connections.md` before adding OAuth-backed ActivePieces tools; most users should create a project MCP connection in the UI and let `mcpConnectionMode` resolve URL/auth instead of hardcoding secrets.

Direct stdio entry:

```json
{
  "name": "playwright",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
}
```

OR HTTP/SSE:

```json
{ "name": "my-server", "transport": "streamable_http", "url": "https://my-server/mcp", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ..." } }
```

Project-resolved ActivePieces piece:

```json
{ "pieceName": "microsoft-outlook" }
```

The resolver matches by `name`, `serverName`, `server_name`, `pieceName`, `serverKey`, or `displayName`, then fills the Knative URL and `X-Connection-External-Id` from the project's `mcp_connection` row. Generated piece MCP URLs should look like `http://ap-microsoft-outlook-service.workflow-builder.svc.cluster.local/mcp` with no explicit `:3100`.

### Playwright sidecar rewrite (important)

Per `src/lib/server/agents/mcp-sidecar.ts`: any entry matching Playwright (by name `"playwright"`, by URL containing `"playwright-mcp"`, or by args containing `"@playwright/mcp"`) is **automatically rewritten** to:

```json
{ "name": "playwright", "serverName": "playwright", "transport": "streamable_http", "url": "http://localhost:3100/mcp" }
```

…and the agent's `AgentRuntime` CR gets `browserSidecar.enabled=true`, which makes the controller mount `chromium` + `playwright-mcp` containers in the pod. The rewrite happens in BOTH session-spawn paths (direct UI sessions + workflow-driven sessions via `/api/internal/sessions/ensure-for-workflow`). You don't need to do anything — just specify the stdio preset and the platform handles the rest.

## Hooks + plugins (per-call)

Per `docs/hooks-and-plugins.md` — workflow-builder ports Claude Code's hooks/plugins to the Python Dapr agent. Per-call overlay:

```json
{
  "with": {
    "agentRef": { "id": "..." },
    "prompt": "...",
    "hooks": {
      "PreToolUse": [
        { "matcher": "Bash:rm.*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "echo 'block rm'", "exitCode": 2 }] }
      ]
    },
    "plugins": ["claude-plugins-official:bash-safety"]
  }
}
```

Events fired in v1: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `Stop`, `Notification`. Hook types: `command` (subprocess) and `callback` (in-process Python).

## Sandbox bridging

Two `durable/run` steps can share a sandbox by chaining through a `workspace/profile` step:

```json
"do": [
  {
    "workspace_profile": {
      "call": "workspace/profile",
      "with": {
        "rootPath": "/sandbox",
        "sandboxTemplate": "dapr-agent",
        "ttlSeconds": 7200,
        "keepAfterRun": true,
        "enabledTools": ["execute_command", "read_file", "write_file", "edit_file", "list_files", "mkdir", "file_stat"]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "code_step": {
      "call": "durable/run",
      "with": {
        "agentRef": { "id": "agt_coding" },
        "prompt": "Build the deck and save to /sandbox/out.pptx",
        "mode": "execute_direct",
        "sandboxName": "${ .workspace_profile.sandboxName }",
        "workspaceRef": "${ .workspace_profile.workspaceRef }",
        "cwd": "/sandbox",
        "maxTurns": 30
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Critical: `workspace/profile.with.keepAfterRun: true` is required. Without it `_should_cleanup_workspaces` (in `sw_workflow.py:130-180`) tears the sandbox down before the `durable/run` step starts.
