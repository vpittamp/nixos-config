"""Window-to-Launch Correlation Engine.

This module implements the multi-signal correlation algorithm that matches newly
created windows to pending launch notifications. Uses application class, timing
proximity, and workspace location to determine correlation confidence.

    Calculate correlation confidence score for a launch-window pair.

    Correlation signals (from spec FR-006, FR-015 to FR-018):
    1. Application class match (REQUIRED baseline): 0.5
    2. Time delta (<1s: +0.3, <2s: +0.2, <5s: +0.1)
