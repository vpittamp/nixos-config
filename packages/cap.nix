# Cap — open-source screen recorder (CapSoftware/Cap), Tauri + webkitgtk.
#
# Upstream ships macOS, Windows and a Linux .deb; there is no Nix package and no
# GitHub release asset (the artifacts live on CrabNebula's CDN, which is what
# https://cap.so/download/linux-deb redirects to). So this unpacks the .deb the
# same way packages/goose-desktop.nix does.
#
# BUMPING: the CDN asset id is opaque and changes every release — there is no
# versioned URL (`/download/cap/cap/<version>/deb-x86_64` is a 404). Re-resolve
# it and take the new hash:
#
#   curl -sIL -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}\n' https://cap.so/download/linux-deb
#   nix store prefetch-file --json <that url> | jq -r .hash
