# Specification Quality Checklist: TypeScript/Deno CLI Rewrite

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec focuses on CLI behavior and user value, not implementation
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - User stories emphasize monitoring windows and productivity
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible, focuses on user outcomes
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - Spec has no clarification markers
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FRs specify clear capabilities (connect, provide subcommand, subscribe, render, etc.)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SCs have specific metrics (under same time, under 15MB, within 500ms, within 100ms, under 50MB)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - SCs focus on user-facing outcomes (workflow completion time, binary size, startup time, memory usage)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 6 edge cases covering daemon unavailability, connection interruption, terminal resize, malformed data, empty state, overflow
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - In Scope and Out of Scope sections clearly define boundaries
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Both sections are complete with specific details

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - FRs are clear and testable through user stories
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Three prioritized stories cover monitoring (P1), querying (P2), project management (P3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Success criteria align with user stories
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Spec stays technology-agnostic despite mentioning TypeScript/Deno (which is the feature itself, not leaked implementation)

## Notes

- **COMPLETE**: All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or direct implementation.
- **Quality**: Specification is comprehensive with clear user value, measurable outcomes, and well-defined scope.
- **No clarifications needed**: User intent is clear - rewrite CLI in TypeScript/Deno while maintaining feature parity.
