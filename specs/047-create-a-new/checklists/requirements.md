# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic Sway Configuration Management Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](/etc/nixos/specs/047-create-a-new/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user value and business needs:
- User stories describe workflows without mentioning specific technologies
- Requirements describe capabilities, not implementation mechanisms
- Success criteria are outcome-focused and measurable

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are clear and testable:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Each functional requirement can be verified through testing
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 5 seconds", "95% success rate")
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Technology-Agnostic Success Criteria
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria avoid implementation details:
- SC-001: "Users can modify and reload keybindings in under 5 seconds" (outcome-focused)
- SC-002: "Users can modify and reload window rules in under 3 seconds" (user experience metric)
- SC-004: "achieving 90% user accuracy in categorization" (measurable user success)
- SC-008: "100% backward compatibility" (outcome without specifying how)
- SC-010: "reduces average time from 120 seconds to under 10 seconds" (performance improvement)

### Scope and Boundaries
✅ **PASS** - Feature scope is well-defined:
- Clear separation between Nix (static) and Python (dynamic) responsibilities (User Story 2)
- Explicit preservation of existing i3pm daemon functionality (FR-010)
- Bounded to Sway configuration management, not general system configuration
- Assumptions documented (Sway IPC capabilities, user comfort with JSON/TOML, etc.)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase. All mandatory sections are filled with concrete details. Requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. The feature has clear boundaries and documented assumptions.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts.
