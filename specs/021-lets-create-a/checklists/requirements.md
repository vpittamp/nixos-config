## Validation Notes

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive User Stories**: 6 well-prioritized user stories covering all major use cases (dynamic rules, PWAs, terminal apps, multi-monitor, workspace metadata, advanced syntax)

2. **Detailed Requirements**: 25 functional requirements with specific i3 IPC integration details (FR-007 to FR-013 specify exact i3 message types)

3. **Technology-Aware Design**: Design principles section properly references i3 IPC patterns while remaining non-prescriptive about implementation

4. **Thorough Testing Strategy**: Covers unit, integration, scenario, performance, and regression testing with specific targets

5. **Migration Planning**: Includes 3-phase migration strategy with rollback plan for safe deployment

6. **Real-World Edge Cases**: 7 edge cases identified based on actual system behavior (JSON errors, monitor hotplug, PWA initialization, title thrashing)

### Critical Schema Alignment Achieved

1. **Project Model Integration**: Project.scoped_classes and workspace_preferences are now properly integrated with priority 1000 (highest)

2. **PatternRule Reuse**: Existing PatternRule dataclass is reused for all pattern matching, avoiding duplicate validation logic

3. **AppClassification Enhancement**: class_patterns field is now properly utilized instead of being ignored by daemon

4. **Configuration Hierarchy**: Clear 4-level precedence system (project > window-rules > app-classes patterns > app-classes lists)

5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing JSON files (projects, app-classes) continue to work without modification

### Areas for Improvement (Optional)

1. **Pattern Type Coverage**: Consider whether `pwa:` pattern type is distinct from `title:` pattern or can be unified
   - Decision: Keep as separate type for clarity and special PWA detection logic

2. **Variable Substitution Complexity**: FR-019 lists 7 variable types - may need priority ordering if some are not available for all window types
   - Decision: Document which variables are available in which contexts

3. **Performance Targets**: FR-006 specifies <1ms classification time - verify this is achievable with Python LRU cache
   - Evidence: Existing PatternMatcher already achieves this (line 103 in pattern_matcher.py)

4. **AppClassification.class_patterns Schema Change**: Changing from Dict[str, str] to List[PatternRule] requires migration
   - Mitigation: Support both formats during loading, convert dict to PatternRule list automatically

## Readiness for Implementation

**Status**: âœ… READY

This specification is complete, comprehensive, and ready for task breakdown and implementation. All mandatory sections are filled out, no clarifications needed, and design principles provide clear guidance while preserving implementation flexibility.

**Next Steps**:
1. Generate tasks.md from this specification
2. Begin implementation with User Story 1 (P1) - Pattern-Based Window Classification
3. Create template window-rules.json and workspaces.json files
4. Integrate pattern matching into daemon event handlers
