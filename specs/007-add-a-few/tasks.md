# Tasks: Multi-Session Remote Desktop & Web Application Launcher

**Input**: Design documents from `/etc/nixos/specs/007-add-a-few/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md (user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in feature specification. Tasks focus on implementation and manual validation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, TERM, CLIP, DOC)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **System modules**: `/etc/nixos/modules/desktop/`, `/etc/nixos/modules/services/`
- **User modules**: `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/`, `/etc/nixos/home-modules/terminal/`
- **Configurations**: `/etc/nixos/configurations/`
- **Assets**: `/etc/nixos/assets/webapp-icons/`
- **Documentation**: `/etc/nixos/docs/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel to US1 if multi-session testing not required
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Extends web app launcher with validation
- **Terminal (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run parallel to US1/US2/US3
- **Clipboard (Phase 7)**: Depends on Terminal (Phase 6) for tmux integration - Can run parallel to US1/US2/US3
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories and features being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Highest priority, MVP candidate
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 for basic functionality
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires User Story 2 (Phase 4) complete - Adds validation and automation on top of US2
- **Terminal (TERM)**: Independent of user stories - Can be worked on in parallel
- **Clipboard (CLIP)**: Requires Terminal for integration testing - Can be worked on in parallel to user stories

### Within Each Phase

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T001-T003 can run in parallel [P]
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T004-T012 are sequential (same files)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Tasks T013-T023 are mostly sequential (testing and validation)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Tasks T024-T025 can run in parallel [P], rest sequential
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Tasks T042-T046 can run in parallel [P], testing sequential
- **Phase 6 (TERM)**: Task T056 independent [P], rest sequential
- **Phase 7 (CLIP)**: Task T078 independent [P], rest sequential
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: Tasks T110-T112 can run in parallel [P], rest sequential

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks (T001, T002, T003) can all run in parallel
- Once Foundational complete: US1, US2, Terminal, Clipboard can all be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Documentation tasks (T110, T111, T112) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Web App Launcher)

```bash
# Launch module creation tasks in parallel:
Task: "Create web-apps-sites.nix (T024)"
Task: "Create web-apps-declarative.nix (T025)"

# Sequential implementation after files created:
Task: "Generate launcher scripts (T027)"
Task: "Create desktop entries (T028)"
# ... etc
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T012) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T023)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test multi-session RDP independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - **MVP ACHIEVED**

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí xrdp multi-session foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (P1) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (P2) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (web app launcher working)
4. Add User Story 3 (P3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (declarative web apps complete)
5. Add Terminal (TERM) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Alacritty integrated)
6. Add Clipboard (CLIP) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (clipboard history working)
7. Polish and documentation ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Full feature complete
8. Each story/feature adds value without breaking previous work

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T012)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T013-T023) - Multi-session RDP
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T024-T041) - Web app launcher
   - Developer C: Terminal (T056-T077) - Alacritty
   - Developer D: Clipboard (T078-T109) - Clipcat
3. Stories/features complete and integrate independently
4. User Story 3 (T042-T055) can be added by Developer B after US2 complete
5. Team converges for Polish phase (T110-T124)

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 124
**Completed**: 79 (63.7%)
**Status**: ‚úÖ All implementation complete - Manual testing pending

**Task Count Per Component**:
- Setup: 3/3 tasks (100%) ‚úÖ (T001-T003)
- Foundational: 9/9 tasks (100%) ‚úÖ (T004-T012)
- User Story 1 (P1): 2/11 tasks (18%) üß™ (T013-T023) - Implementation complete
- User Story 2 (P2): 11/18 tasks (61%) üß™ (T024-T041) - Implementation complete
- User Story 3 (P3): 6/14 tasks (43%) üß™ (T042-T055) - Implementation complete (2025-10-16)
- Terminal (Alacritty): 14/22 tasks (64%) üß™ (T056-T077) - Implementation complete
- Clipboard (Clipcat): 19/32 tasks (59%) üß™ (T078-T109) - Implementation complete
- Polish & Documentation: 0/15 tasks (0%) ‚è∏Ô∏è (T110-T124) - Not started

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- 3 parallel tasks in Setup phase
- Multiple independent phases (US1, US2, TERM, CLIP) can be developed in parallel after Foundational
- 3 parallel documentation tasks in Polish phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- User Story 1: Connect from two devices, verify both sessions active
- User Story 2: Launch web apps via rofi, verify separate windows with unique WM_CLASS
- User Story 3: Add/modify/remove web app in config, rebuild, verify automatic changes
- Terminal: Launch Alacritty, verify tmux/sesh/bash work identically
- Clipboard: Copy from multiple apps, access history via $mod+v, verify 95% capture rate

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (Multi-session RDP)
- Provides immediate value: fix the most critical workflow blocker
- Can be delivered and validated independently
- Foundation for all other features

**Complexity Notes**:
- User Story 3 requires User Story 2 complete (validation on top of launcher)
- Clipboard requires Terminal for integration testing (tmux clipboard integration)
- All user stories require Foundational phase complete (xrdp multi-session configured)
- No circular dependencies identified
- Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific component (US1, US2, US3, TERM, CLIP, DOC)
- Each user story/feature should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story/feature independently
- Test configuration with `dry-build` before every `switch`
- Follow NixOS Constitution principles: declarative, modular, test-before-apply
