# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Session Remote Desktop & Web Application Launcher

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All resolved via user input
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 17 edge cases including 1Password, terminal, and clipboard scenarios
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 3 prioritized user stories
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- Q1: Session model → Hybrid approach (one primary + additional concurrent sessions)
- Q2: Web app lifecycle → User-configurable per application

**Additional Requirements Added**:
- 1Password integration requirements (FR-019 through FR-023)
- Terminal emulator requirements (FR-024 through FR-027) - Alacritty as default with home-manager preservation
- Clipboard history requirements (FR-028 through FR-034) - Robust clipboard management with i3wm-native approaches
- Architectural reference to activity-aware-apps-native.nix pattern (FR-018)
- i3wm as target desktop environment with X11 display server
- Enhanced edge cases for 1Password, terminal, and clipboard scenarios
- Enhanced success criteria for 1Password functionality (SC-008 through SC-010)
- Enhanced success criteria for terminal functionality (SC-011 through SC-013)
- Enhanced success criteria for clipboard functionality (SC-014 through SC-017)

## Notes

✅ All validation criteria met. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning.
