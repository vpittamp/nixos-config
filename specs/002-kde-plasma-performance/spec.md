# Feature Specification: KDE Plasma Performance Optimization for KubeVirt VMs

**Feature Branch**: `002-kde-plasma-performance`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High
**Context**: KubeVirt VM accessed via RustDesk experiences poor graphical performance

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Responsive Window Operations (Priority: P1)

As a remote desktop user, I need window operations (moving, resizing, switching) to feel instant and responsive when accessing my KubeVirt VM via RustDesk, so that I can work efficiently without frustrating lag.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of desktop usability. Laggy window operations make every task feel slow and frustrating. This delivers immediate, noticeable value.

**Independent Test**: Open 5-10 windows, drag them around the screen, resize them, switch between them with Alt+Tab. Measure response time from input to visual update. Success means operations feel instantaneous (< 100ms perceived latency).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** KDE Plasma compositor is optimized, **When** user drags a window across the screen, **Then** window follows cursor smoothly without lag or tearing
2. **Given** multiple windows are open, **When** user presses Alt+Tab, **Then** window switcher appears instantly (< 50ms) with smooth transitions
3. **Given** user resizes a window, **When** user drags window edge, **Then** window resizes in real-time without stuttering
4. **Given** RustDesk connection is active, **When** user clicks window to focus, **Then** window gains focus and responds to input immediately

### User Story 2 - Low CPU Compositor Usage (Priority: P1)

As a system administrator, I need the KDE compositor to use minimal CPU resources (< 20% during normal operations), so that VM resources are available for actual applications rather than being consumed by desktop effects.

**Why this priority**: High compositor CPU usage directly impacts application performance and VM scalability. Every CPU cycle wasted on visual effects is unavailable for productive work.

**Independent Test**: Monitor compositor CPU usage with `htop` while performing normal desktop operations (browsing, editing documents, switching windows). Success means kwin_x11 process stays below 20% CPU usage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** compositor is optimized, **When** system is idle, **Then** kwin_x11 process uses < 5% CPU
2. **Given** user is working normally, **When** opening/closing/switching windows, **Then** kwin_x11 CPU usage peaks at < 20%
3. **Given** expensive visual effects are disabled, **When** measuring CPU usage over 1 hour, **Then** average compositor CPU usage is < 10%
4. **Given** VM has 4-6 vCPUs allocated, **When** compositor is running, **Then** at least 3 vCPUs remain available for applications

### User Story 3 - Smooth Cursor Movement (Priority: P2)

As a remote desktop user, I need the mouse cursor to move smoothly without jumpiness or lag, so that precise clicking and dragging operations are possible.

**Why this priority**: Cursor lag makes the entire desktop feel unresponsive and makes precise operations (clicking small buttons, selecting text) frustrating. This is critical for user experience but depends on P1 optimizations.

**Independent Test**: Move cursor rapidly across screen, draw circles, click rapidly on various UI elements. Measure cursor lag between local movement and remote display. Success means cursor feels smooth and responsive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** optimized configuration, **When** user moves cursor rapidly, **Then** cursor tracks smoothly without jumping or stuttering
2. **Given** RustDesk connection, **When** user hovers over UI elements, **Then** hover effects appear immediately (< 100ms)
3. **Given** user performs drag-and-drop, **When** dragging item across screen, **Then** dragged item follows cursor without lag
4. **Given** cursor is moving, **When** system is under moderate load, **Then** cursor remains responsive and smooth

---

### User Story 4 - Fast Screen Updates (Priority: P2)

As a remote desktop user, I need screen content to update quickly when scrolling or changing views, so that reading documents and browsing web pages feels natural.

**Why this priority**: Slow screen updates make reading and navigation frustrating. This significantly impacts productivity for document-heavy workflows.

**Independent Test**: Scroll through long documents, browse web pages, watch video content. Measure frame rate and lag between action and screen update. Success means smooth 25-30 FPS with minimal tearing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** browser is open, **When** user scrolls web page, **Then** page scrolls smoothly at 25-30 FPS without tearing
2. **Given** document editor is open, **When** user types rapidly, **Then** text appears on screen immediately (< 50ms latency)
3. **Given** file manager displays many files, **When** user scrolls through list, **Then** scrolling is smooth without frame drops
4. **Given** RustDesk compression is enabled, **When** screen content changes, **Then** updates appear within 100ms

---

### User Story 5 - Minimal Resource Overhead (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I need unnecessary KDE services (Baloo indexing, Akonadi PIM) to be disabled in VM environment, so that RAM and CPU are available for productive work.

**Why this priority**: Many KDE services are unnecessary in a remote-only VM and consume resources. Disabling them frees up capacity but isn't critical for immediate usability.

**Independent Test**: Check running processes with `ps aux`, measure RAM usage before/after optimization. Success means 1-2GB RAM freed and several CPU-intensive background processes eliminated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Baloo is disabled, **When** checking processes, **Then** baloo_file and baloo_file_extractor are not running
2. **Given** Akonadi is disabled, **When** checking processes, **Then** akonadi_control and related processes are not running
3. **Given** services are optimized, **When** measuring idle RAM usage, **Then** system uses 1-2GB less RAM than before
4. **Given** unnecessary services disabled, **When** monitoring CPU, **Then** background CPU usage is < 5%

---

### User Story 6 - Optimized RustDesk Configuration (Priority: P3)

As a remote desktop user, I need RustDesk configured with optimal codec and compression settings, so that video stream quality balances between visual fidelity and network bandwidth.

**Why this priority**: RustDesk has various codec options that can improve performance, but the defaults are reasonable. This is an incremental improvement rather than critical fix.

**Independent Test**: Test different codec settings (VP8, VP9, H.264) and compression levels. Measure perceived quality, latency, and bandwidth usage. Success means optimal balance for LAN/VPN scenarios.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** RustDesk with optimized codec, **When** connecting over LAN, **Then** desktop appears sharp with minimal compression artifacts
2. **Given** RustDesk compression tuned, **When** monitoring network usage, **Then** bandwidth usage is 10-30 Mbps for 1080p desktop
3. **Given** codec is configured, **When** performing normal operations, **Then** no noticeable increase in latency vs current setup
4. **Given** direct IP access enabled, **When** connecting, **Then** connection establishes in < 3 seconds

---

### User Story 7 - Declarative Configuration (Priority: P4)

As a system administrator, I need all performance optimizations defined in NixOS configuration files, so that configuration is reproducible and version-controlled.

**Why this priority**: Aligns with constitution's "Declarative Configuration Over Imperative" principle, but actual performance impact is secondary to correctness of optimizations themselves.

**Independent Test**: Build fresh VM from NixOS configuration, verify all optimizations are applied automatically without manual steps. Success means zero manual configuration required post-deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** NixOS configuration with optimizations, **When** building fresh VM, **Then** all compositor settings are applied automatically
2. **Given** declarative service configuration, **When** VM boots, **Then** Baloo and Akonadi are disabled without manual intervention
3. **Given** KubeVirt VM spec, **When** VM is created, **Then** dedicated CPU placement and IOThreads are configured
4. **Given** configuration in Git, **When** comparing two builds, **Then** desktop performance is identical (reproducible)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GPU passthrough is added later (configuration should adapt)?
- How does system behave when VM is resized (more/fewer vCPUs allocated)?
- What occurs when RustDesk connection is lost and reconnected?
- How are settings preserved when KDE Plasma is upgraded?
- What happens if user manually enables visual effects through GUI?
- How does system perform when multiple windows show video content?
- What occurs when network latency increases (LAN â†’ WAN)?
