## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Application tags: Flat single-level tags (e.g., "development", "terminal")
2. Layout restoration: Close existing project windows before restoring
3. Multiple layouts: One layout per project (not multiple named layouts)

**Next Steps**: Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
