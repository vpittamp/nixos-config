# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Walker/Elephant Launcher Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**:

✅ **Content Quality**: All items pass
- Spec is written from user perspective focusing on what and why, not how
- No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies) are complete

✅ **Requirement Completeness**: All items pass
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- All 20 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "System MUST enable todo list provider with `!` prefix" can be verified by checking configuration)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 5 seconds", "under 3 seconds", "100% success rate", "less than 200ms")
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation details
- 23 acceptance scenarios defined across 5 prioritized user stories
- 8 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary scenarios
- Scope clearly defines what is included and excluded
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

✅ **Feature Readiness**: All items pass
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria define measurable outcomes for feature success
- Specification maintains clean separation between requirements and implementation

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All quality checks pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase.
