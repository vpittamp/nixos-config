# Tasks: Hetzner Cloud Sway Configuration with Headless Wayland

**Feature**: 046-revise-my-spec
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/046-revise-my-spec/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No automated tests required - manual validation via quickstart.md test scenarios

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **NixOS Configuration**: `/etc/nixos/` repository root
- **System modules**: `/etc/nixos/modules/`
- **Home-manager modules**: `/etc/nixos/home-modules/`
- **Configurations**: `/etc/nixos/configurations/`

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T033 [P] [US4] Review Sway renderer config and ensure WLR_RENDERER=pixman is set for software rendering (already in configurations/hetzner-sway.nix from T007)
- [ ] T034 [US4] Deploy configuration if changes made: `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner-sway --target-host vpittamp@hetzner --use-remote-sudo`
- [ ] T035 [US4] Execute Test Scenario 4 from quickstart.md (Steps 4.1-4.5: measure window creation latency, workspace switching latency, project switching performance, resource usage, keyboard input latency)
- [ ] T036 [US4] Document performance findings in quickstart.md or create performance tuning guide if adjustments were needed

**Checkpoint**: User Story 4 complete - VNC performance optimized and acceptable for remote development workflows

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Configuration Isolation from Existing Hetzner (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Verify hetzner-sway is completely isolated from existing hetzner i3 configuration, both can coexist, and can switch between them safely

**Independent Test**: Build both hetzner and hetzner-sway configurations, verify they produce different system closures, confirm hetzner.nix is unchanged after hetzner-sway deployment

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T037 [US5] Verify hetzner.nix has not been modified (git diff configurations/hetzner.nix should show no changes)
- [ ] T038 [US5] Build hetzner configuration locally: `nixos-rebuild dry-build --flake .#hetzner`
- [ ] T039 [US5] Compare system closures: `nix build .#nixosConfigurations.hetzner.config.system.build.toplevel -o result-hetzner && nix build .#nixosConfigurations.hetzner-sway.config.system.build.toplevel -o result-hetzner-sway`
- [ ] T040 [US5] Execute Test Scenario 5 from quickstart.md (Steps 5.1-5.4: verify hetzner config unchanged, test switching between configurations, verify no Wayland packages in hetzner, verify both configs build from same flake)
- [ ] T041 [US5] Document rollback procedure in quickstart.md (how to switch from hetzner-sway back to hetzner if needed)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 5 complete - configuration isolation validated, both configs coexist safely

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Multi-Monitor Support via Virtual Displays (Priority: P3) [OPTIONAL]

**Goal**: Support multiple virtual outputs (HEADLESS-1, HEADLESS-2) with workspace distribution across outputs for advanced multi-monitor remote workflows

**Independent Test**: Configure headless Sway with two virtual outputs, run `i3pm monitors status`, verify workspace 1-2 on HEADLESS-1 and workspace 3-70 on HEADLESS-2

### Implementation for User Story 6

- [ ] T042 [US6] Update Sway output configuration in `home-modules/desktop/sway.nix` to add second virtual output (HEADLESS-2, 1920x1080@60Hz, positioned at x=1920, y=0)
- [ ] T043 [US6] Update i3pm workspace-monitor mapping config if needed (ensure workspace distribution logic handles virtual outputs correctly)
- [ ] T044 [US6] Deploy configuration: `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner-sway --target-host vpittamp@hetzner --use-remote-sudo`
- [ ] T045 [US6] Execute Test Scenario 6 from quickstart.md (Steps 6.1-6.5: verify two virtual outputs created, test workspace distribution, test VNC access to second output, verify monitor status command)
- [ ] T046 [US6] Document multi-output configuration process and limitations (wayvnc exposes one output at a time, switching requires config change and restart)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 6 complete - multi-virtual-output support functional for advanced workflows

---

## Phase 9: Polish & Documentation

**Purpose**: Final integration testing, documentation updates, and edge case validation

- [ ] T047 Run automated test suite from quickstart.md: `bash test-feature-046.sh` (create test script based on quickstart.md test scenarios)
- [ ] T048 Execute all 5 edge case tests from quickstart.md (VNC disconnection handling, wayvnc failure recovery, display scaling, software rendering, parallel deployments)
- [ ] T049 Update `/etc/nixos/CLAUDE.md` with Feature 046 quickstart reference and common commands
- [ ] T050 Document troubleshooting tips based on test findings in quickstart.md (expand troubleshooting section with actual issues encountered)
- [ ] T051 [P] Create git commit for Feature 046: `git add . && git commit -m "feat(hetzner-sway): Add headless Sway configuration for Hetzner Cloud VM with VNC remote access (Feature 046)"`
- [ ] T052 [P] Validate all success criteria from spec.md are met (SC-001 through SC-010)

**Checkpoint**: Feature 046 complete and validated - ready for production use

## Implementation Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Incremental delivery by user story

1. **Start with MVP** (US1 - Phase 3):
   - Delivers basic headless Sway with VNC
   - Validates technical approach (headless backend, wayvnc, virtual outputs)
   - Testable end-to-end within 3-4 hours
   - Provides immediate value for basic remote access

2. **Add Core Workflows** (US2-US3 - Phases 4-5):
   - Enables project management (US2)
   - Enables keyboard-driven launcher (US3)
   - Completes P1 scope for daily development use
   - Testable incrementally as each story completes

3. **Optimize and Validate** (US4-US5 - Phases 6-7):
   - Improve performance for production use (US4)
   - Validate configuration isolation and safety (US5)
   - Completes P2 scope for production deployment

4. **Optional Enhancement** (US6 - Phase 8):
   - Multi-monitor support for advanced users
   - Can be deferred to future iteration if not immediately needed
   - Testable independently from other stories

5. **Polish and Deploy** (Phase 9):
   - Final integration testing
   - Documentation updates
   - Edge case validation
   - Ready for production

**Rollback Plan**: If issues arise during testing, can switch back to hetzner configuration:
```bash
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner --target-host vpittamp@hetzner --use-remote-sudo
sudo reboot
```

**Testing Approach**: Manual validation via quickstart.md test scenarios (no automated tests required per spec)

---

## Dependencies on Other Features

**Hard Dependencies** (must be complete):
- ‚úÖ **Feature 043**: Walker/Elephant Wayland-native support (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ **Feature 045**: M1 Sway migration with i3pm daemon Sway compatibility (Phases 1-2 COMPLETE - sufficient for Feature 046)

**Soft Dependencies** (nice to have):
- üîµ **Feature 045 Complete**: Full M1 Sway validation (not blocking - hetzner-sway can proceed independently)

---

## Validation Checklist
