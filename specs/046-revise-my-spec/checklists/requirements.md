# Specification Quality Checklist: Hetzner Cloud Sway Configuration with Headless Wayland

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS

- Specification focuses on user needs (remote developer workflows, keyboard-driven productivity)
- Technical details (WLR_BACKENDS, wayvnc, i3ipc) are in context of capabilities, not prescribing implementation
- Written accessibly with clear user stories and business value
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed with comprehensive details

### Requirement Completeness: PASS

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions made with informed defaults:
  - Headless backend chosen based on research (WLR_BACKENDS=headless is standard for remote Wayland)
  - VNC chosen over RDP (Wayland-native solution, RDP requires X11)
  - Software rendering assumed (typical for VM environments without GPU passthrough)
  - Virtual output resolution defaulted to 1920x1080 (standard remote desktop resolution)
- All 31 functional requirements are testable and specific
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (time thresholds, latency targets, accuracy percentages)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "perform window management via VNC" vs "configure Sway with WLR_BACKENDS")
- 6 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (26 total acceptance criteria)
- 6 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section (8 explicit exclusions)
- Dependencies (6 items) and assumptions (6 items) documented

### Feature Readiness: PASS

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (3 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3) with independent testing criteria
- Success criteria provide clear pass/fail thresholds (10 measurable outcomes)
- No implementation leakage in specification language (technical terms explained in business context)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Research conducted confirms Wayland/Sway headless operation is viable on Hetzner Cloud VMs
- Feature properly scoped as addition (hetzner-sway configuration) without modifying existing hetzner or M1 configurations
- All design decisions justified by:
  - Research findings (wayvnc for headless Wayland, WLR_BACKENDS=headless)
  - Existing architecture patterns (parallel to M1 Sway migration in Feature 045)
  - User requirements (configuration isolation, i3pm daemon parity)
- Feature has clear validation path via success criteria
