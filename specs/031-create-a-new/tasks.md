**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

### Python Backend Foundation

- [X] T009 [P] Implement Pydantic models in `home-modules/tools/i3-window-rules-service/models.py` (Window, Pattern, PatternType, Scope, WindowRule, ApplicationDefinition, DiscoveryResult, ValidationResult, ConfigurationBackup)

- [X] T013 [P] Create main entry point in `home-modules/tools/i3-window-rules-service/__main__.py` and wrapper script

### Deno CLI Foundation

- [X] T014 [P] TypeScript interfaces (EXISTING - i3pm-deno already has comprehensive type system in models.ts)

- [ ] T094 [P] Add comprehensive error handling to Deno CLI (catch JSON-RPC errors, display user-friendly messages, suggest troubleshooting steps)
- [ ] T095 [P] Add logging to Python services using standard logging module (log discovery attempts, validation results, migration operations to systemd journal)
- [ ] T096 [P] Add debug mode flag to CLI in `home-modules/tools/i3pm/main.ts` (--debug shows verbose output, logs JSON-RPC calls, displays stack traces)

### Performance & Optimization

3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T022-T030) - Discovery functionality
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 5 Basic (T031-T034) - CLI integration for discovery
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test `i3pm rules discover --app pavucontrol`
6. If working, move to validation features

**Expected Result**: Can discover pattern for any single application via unified CLI

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Setup + Foundational** (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **+ User Story 1** (Phase 3) ‚Üí Single app discovery works ‚Üí **Test independently**
3. **+ User Story 5 Basic** (Phase 4 partial) ‚Üí CLI interface operational ‚Üí **Test independently**
4. **+ User Story 2** (Phase 5) ‚Üí Pattern validation works ‚Üí **Test independently**
5. **+ User Story 3** (Phase 6) ‚Üí Migration works ‚Üí **Test independently**
6. **+ Bulk Discovery** (Phase 8) ‚Üí Can process 70+ applications ‚Üí **Test with 10 apps**
7. **+ User Story 4** (Phase 7) ‚Üí Interactive TUI for fine-tuning ‚Üí **Test with new app**
8. **+ Polish** (Phase 9) ‚Üí Production-ready

Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational done**, split work:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Discovery) - Phase 3
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (CLI Integration) - Phase 4 (waits for T022-T025 from Dev A)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 2 (Validation) - Phase 5 (can start after Phase 2)
3. **Once US1, US2 complete**, Developer C continues with:
   - User Story 3 (Migration) - Phase 6
4. **Once US1, US2, US3 complete**, Developer A or B implements:
   - User Story 4 (Interactive) - Phase 7
   - Bulk Discovery - Phase 8

- **Bulk Discovery**: 6 tasks can run in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: 15+ tasks can run in parallel (documentation, error handling, optimization)

**Total parallel opportunities**: 40+ tasks that can be executed concurrently

### Independent Test Criteria

**User Story 1 (Discovery)**: Launch pavucontrol ‚Üí Capture WM_CLASS "Pavucontrol" ‚Üí Generate class pattern ‚Üí Verify pattern matches ‚Üí Success

**User Story 5 (CLI Integration)**: Run `i3pm rules discover --app pavucontrol` ‚Üí CLI calls Python service ‚Üí Displays formatted table with pattern ‚Üí Success

**User Story 2 (Validation)**: Configure 5 test patterns ‚Üí Launch each application ‚Üí Verify all 5 patterns match correctly ‚Üí Verify all 5 windows on correct workspaces ‚Üí Success

**User Story 3 (Migration)**: Start with 5 broken patterns ‚Üí Run discovery ‚Üí Execute migration ‚Üí Verify window-rules.json updated ‚Üí Verify windows now on correct workspaces ‚Üí Success

**User Story 4 (Interactive)**: Launch TUI ‚Üí Select application ‚Üí Watch capture ‚Üí Review/adjust pattern ‚Üí Assign workspace ‚Üí Test relaunch ‚Üí Verify workspace ‚Üí Success

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Story 1 (Discovery) + User Story 5 Basic (CLI)

**Rationale**: Provides immediate value - can discover correct patterns for any application via unified CLI interface. Validates hybrid Deno+Python architecture. Enables manual configuration updates while automated migration is being built.

**Time Estimate**:
- Setup + Foundational: ~2-3 days
- User Story 1: ~2-3 days
- User Story 5 Basic: ~1 day
- **MVP Total**: ~5-7 days

**Next Priority**: User Story 2 (Validation) to ensure discovered patterns actually work before migrating 65+ broken rules.

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies within same phase
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests included (not requested in spec)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Architecture follows Constitution Principles X (Python for i3 IPC) + XIII (Deno for CLI)
- JSON-RPC communication ensures clean separation between Deno CLI frontend and Python backend services

---

**Tasks Complete**: 110 tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and delivery
