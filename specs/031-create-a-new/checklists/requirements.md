# Specification Quality Checklist: Automated Window Rules Discovery and Validation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT users need (pattern discovery, validation, migration) without specifying HOW (Python, i3ipc, specific libraries)
- ✅ FR-012 appropriately considers i3king logic evaluation as a functional requirement, not an implementation mandate
- ✅ All technical terms (WM_CLASS, i3 tree, rofi, xdotool) are contextually necessary for domain understanding
- ✅ Problem Statement, User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria sections all complete
- ✅ rofi launcher integration added based on real-world workflow (Meta+D keybinding simulation via xdotool)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec (architectural questions documented separately in "Key Architectural Research Questions" section)
- ✅ All 41 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail conditions (added FR-012 for rule application research, FR-030A/B/C for command registry)
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (15s, 95% accuracy, 20 minutes, 90% time reduction)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes, not system internals
- ✅ Four prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (16 total scenarios)
- ✅ Edge cases section covers 12 common failure scenarios with expected behaviors (including rofi launcher, parameterized commands, desktop file generation)
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 14 key assumptions about i3, applications, rofi workflow, desktop files, command parameters, and environment
- ✅ Key Architectural Research Questions section documents two fundamental design decisions with trade-off analysis

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ 41 functional requirements organized by category (Discovery, Pattern Matching, Validation, Configuration Management, Daemon Integration, Interactive Mode)
- ✅ User stories cover complete workflow: P1 Discovery → P2 Validation → P3 Migration → P4 Interactive refinement
- ✅ 10 success criteria provide measurable targets for all major capabilities
- ✅ FR-012 documents key research decision: native i3 rules vs event-driven Python daemon for rule application
- ✅ FR-013 appropriately questions relevance of i3king logic given modern i3 improvements, maintaining technology agnosticism
- ✅ FR-030A/B/C establish command registry with parameterized commands for project-specific launches
- ✅ Desktop file customization integrated for declarative NixOS configuration

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the planning phase. All quality criteria are met:

- **Clarity**: Problem statement clearly explains the inference-based pattern failure discovered in Phase 11 testing
- **Completeness**: 4 prioritized user stories, 41 functional requirements (including rule application research and command registry), 10 success criteria, 12 edge cases (including rofi launcher workflow, parameterized commands, desktop file generation)
- **Testability**: All requirements and scenarios are independently testable with clear pass/fail conditions
- **Technology Agnostic**: Focuses on capabilities and outcomes without prescribing implementation details (rofi/xdotool/desktop files mentioned as existing real-world workflow tools and NixOS patterns, not implementation mandate)
- **Scoped**: Clear boundaries defined in Out of Scope section, with Key Architectural Research Questions documented separately for planning phase decisions
- **Actionable**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` to decompose into implementation tasks

## Recommendations for Planning Phase

When proceeding to `/speckit.plan`, prioritize:

1. **P1 (Discovery)**: Foundation - must work before other priorities make sense
2. **P2 (Validation)**: Quality assurance - ensures discovered patterns actually work
3. **P3 (Migration)**: Practical application - makes discoveries actionable
4. **P4 (Interactive)**: User experience enhancement - can be deferred to later iterations

**Key Architectural Considerations**:

1. **Rule Application Mechanism** (FR-012): **CRITICAL DECISION REQUIRED** - This is the most important architectural decision for this feature:
   - Native i3 `for_window` rules vs Event-driven Python daemon
   - Impacts: Discovery approach, configuration management, daemon integration, project context support
   - Decision criteria documented in spec section "Key Architectural Research Questions"
   - **Recommendation**: Research both approaches early in planning, evaluate against project context requirements
   - If project-scoped applications are essential → Python daemon likely required
   - If simple static mapping is sufficient → Native i3 rules may simplify architecture

2. **Command Registry** (FR-030A/B/C): The application command registry with parameterized commands is a foundational component that should be designed early in planning. It affects:
   - How discovery launches applications (base command vs parameterized)
   - How validation tests patterns (must work for both forms)
   - How desktop files are generated/customized
   - How the system integrates with project-specific launches

3. **i3king Evaluation** (FR-013): Consider evaluating i3king's multi-criteria scoring during technical research phase of planning, as this requirement appropriately leaves it as an open question pending investigation of modern i3 capabilities.

4. **Desktop File Integration**: Plan how to generate NixOS-compatible desktop file configurations that can be added to /etc/nixos declarative structure.
