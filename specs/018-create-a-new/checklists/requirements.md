# Specification Quality Checklist: i3 Project System Testing & Debugging Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Pass**: All checklist items pass validation.

The specification is complete and ready for planning (`/speckit.plan`).

### Strengths

- **Clear prioritization**: 4 user stories (P1-P4) ordered by value and independence
- **Well-defined MVP**: P1 (Manual Interactive Testing) delivers immediate value and is fully testable
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: All SC metrics focus on outcomes (time to diagnose, test execution time) without implementation details
- **Comprehensive requirements**: 27 functional requirements covering all aspects of testing framework, including monitor/output tracking
- **Good edge case coverage**: 9 edge cases identified addressing error scenarios, boundary conditions, and monitor configuration changes
- **Clear scope boundaries**: Explicitly states what's in/out of scope
- **Strong assumptions section**: Documents reasonable defaults for test environment
- **i3wm IPC alignment**: Explicitly requires use of i3's native IPC message types (GET_OUTPUTS, GET_WORKSPACES, GET_TREE, GET_MARKS) ensuring consistency with i3's authoritative state
- **Monitor tracking integration**: Includes comprehensive monitor/output tracking and workspace assignment validation using i3's native APIs

### Minor Notes

- Dependencies section mentions Python asyncio and i3ipc libraries but this is appropriate as it refers to existing implementation, not new choices
- Framework names (tmux, i3-msg, xrandr) are mentioned but these are existing tools, not new implementation choices
- Success criteria are appropriately user-focused (e.g., "reduces time to diagnose by 50%" not "API latency <100ms")
- i3 IPC message types (GET_OUTPUTS, GET_WORKSPACES) are appropriately mentioned as they represent the interface contract, not implementation details

The spec successfully balances comprehensive test coverage with clear user value proposition, and now includes critical monitor/display tracking functionality aligned with i3wm's native IPC API.
