# Specification Quality Checklist: IPC Launch Context for Multi-Instance App Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality** - PASSED
- Specification avoids all implementation details (no mention of Python, async/await, dataclasses, etc.)
- Focus is on WHAT the system does and WHY (solve multi-instance tracking problem)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (business-level descriptions)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness** - PASSED
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements fully specified
- All 18 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
  - Example: FR-001 "Launcher wrapper MUST send launch notification" - testable by verifying notification sent before app execution
  - Example: FR-006 "confidence using multiple signals" - testable by measuring confidence scores
- All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
  - SC-001: "100% correct project assignment" - quantifiable
  - SC-003: "under 100ms for 95% of launches" - measurable performance target
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no APIs, databases, frameworks mentioned)
- 5 user stories with 15 total acceptance scenarios covering all primary flows
- 8 edge cases identified with explicit handling behavior
- Scope clearly bounded in "Out of Scope" section (9 items explicitly excluded)
- 5 dependencies and 8 assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness** - PASSED
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios:
  - FR-001-002 (launch notification) → User Story 1, Scenario 1
  - FR-005-007 (correlation) → User Story 2, Scenarios 1-2
  - FR-004, FR-014 (expiration) → User Story 3, Scenarios 1-2
  - FR-011 (first-match-wins) → User Story 2, Scenario 3
- User scenarios cover sequential launches (P1), rapid launches (P2), timeouts (P2), multi-app (P3), workspace disambiguation (P3)
- Feature delivers measurable outcome: 100% correct project assignment for sequential launches (SC-001)
- No implementation leakage - all technical concepts kept abstract (e.g., "correlation algorithm" not "regex matching" or "hash table lookup")

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No blocking issues identified
- Test coverage expectations clearly defined in SC-010 (100% edge case coverage)
- Performance targets defined for correlation (<10ms), timeout (5±0.5s), memory (<5MB)
