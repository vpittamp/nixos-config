# Code Verification Report: Polling & Conflicts (T029-T032)

**Feature**: 039-create-a-new
**Tasks**: T029, T030, T031, T032
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: VERIFICATION COMPLETE

## Overview

Per the audit results from T019-T020, we expected to find:
- ✅ **ZERO** polling-based event processing code
- ✅ **ZERO** conflicting window filtering APIs

This report verifies those findings and confirms no code removal is necessary.

---

## T029-T030: Polling-Based Event Processing

**Task T029**: Identify all duplicate event processing code paths (polling vs event-driven)
**Task T030**: Remove all polling-based event processing code

### Verification Method

```bash
# Search for polling patterns
grep -r "while True" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/ | grep -v test | grep -v __pycache__
grep -r "time.sleep" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/ | grep -v test | grep -v __pycache__
grep -r "threading.Timer" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/ | grep -v test
grep -r "setInterval" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/
```

### Results

**Polling Loops Found**: **0**
**Sleep Calls Found**: **0** (except in legitimate error handling/retry logic)
**Timer Usage Found**: **0**

### Event-Driven Architecture Confirmed

**Connection.py** - i3 IPC event subscriptions:
```python
# Line ~100: Event subscription setup
await i3.subscribe([
    Event.WINDOW,      # window::new, window::close, window::focus
    Event.WORKSPACE,   # workspace::focus, workspace::init
    Event.OUTPUT,      # output::change (monitor connect/disconnect)
    Event.TICK,        # tick event for manual triggers
])
```

**Handlers.py** - Async event handlers:
```python
# Event handlers registered:
- on_window_new()
- on_window_close()
- on_window_focus()
- on_workspace_focus()
- on_output_change()
- on_tick()
```

### Conclusion for T029-T030

✅ **VERIFIED**: No polling-based code exists in codebase
✅ **NO ACTION REQUIRED**: Nothing to remove
✅ **ARCHITECTURE**: 100% event-driven via i3 IPC subscriptions

**Status**: T029 ✅ COMPLETE (no duplicates found)
**Status**: T030 ✅ COMPLETE (no polling code to remove)

## T031-T032: Conflicting Window Filtering APIs

**Task T031**: Identify conflicting window filtering APIs
**Task T032**: Consolidate to single API, remove duplicates

### Verification Method

```bash
# Search for window filtering functions
grep -r "def.*filter.*window" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/ | grep -v test
grep -r "def.*hide.*window" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/ | grep -v test
grep -r "def.*show.*window" home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/ | grep -v test
```

### Results

**Window Filtering Implementations Found**: **1**

**Location**: `home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/services/window_filter.py`

**Primary Function**: `filter_windows_by_project()`
- Lines: ~200-300
- Purpose: Filter windows based on project context
- Usage: Called from tick event handler

### API Analysis

**Function Signature**:
```python
async def filter_windows_by_project(
    conn: Connection,
    active_project: Optional[str],
    application_registry: Dict[str, Any],
    workspace_tracker: Any
) -> None:
    """Filter windows based on active project."""
```

**Call Sites**:
1. `handlers.py:on_tick()` - Single call site
2. No other call sites found

### Window Filtering Architecture

**Single Implementation**:
- ✅ All window filtering logic in `services/window_filter.py`
- ✅ Single entry point: `filter_windows_by_project()`
- ✅ Called from single location (tick event handler)
- ✅ Uses i3 scratchpad for hiding windows
- ✅ Uses workspace restoration for showing windows

**No Conflicting APIs**:
- ❌ No alternative filtering functions found
- ❌ No duplicate hide/show logic
- ❌ No legacy filtering code

### Conclusion for T031-T032

✅ **VERIFIED**: Single window filtering API exists
✅ **NO CONFLICTS**: No competing implementations found
✅ **NO ACTION REQUIRED**: Nothing to consolidate or remove

**Status**: T031 ✅ COMPLETE (no conflicts found)
**Status**: T032 ✅ COMPLETE (no duplicates to remove)

## Cross-Verification with Audit Report

### Audit Report Findings (T019)

From `specs/039-create-a-new/audit-report.md`:

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Duplicate function implementations | 0 found |
| Conflicting APIs | 0 found (8 false positives - OOP polymorphism) |
| Polling-based code | 0 found |
| Event-driven architecture | ✅ Confirmed |

### Verification Report Findings (T029-T032)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Polling loops | 0 found |
| Sleep-based delays | 0 found (except error retry) |
| Duplicate filtering APIs | 0 found |
| Single window filter implementation | ✅ Confirmed |

**Conclusion**: Verification findings **100% match** audit report findings.

## Code Health Summary

### Event Processing

**Architecture**: ✅ **Pure Event-Driven**
- i3 IPC event subscriptions: ✅ Active
- Async event handlers: ✅ Implemented
- Event buffer for diagnostics: ✅ Present
- Polling loops: ❌ None found

### Window Filtering

**Architecture**: ✅ **Single Consolidated API**
- Primary implementation: `services/window_filter.py`
- Call sites: 1 (tick event handler)
- Conflicting APIs: ❌ None found
- Duplicate logic: ❌ None found

### Workspace Assignment

**Architecture**: ✅ **Now Enhanced with Service Extraction**
- Previous: Embedded in handlers.py (single implementation)
- Current: Extracted to `services/workspace_assigner.py` (T027)
- Enhancement: Full 4-tier priority system implemented
- Call sites: 1 (to be updated in T028)

---

## Recommendations

### T028: Update Call Sites

**Action Required**: Update `handlers.py:on_window_new()` to use new `workspace_assigner.py` service

**Current Code** (handlers.py:506-560):
```python
# Feature 037 T026-T029: Guaranteed workspace assignment on launch
# OLD: Embedded logic
```

**Target Code**:
```python
# Feature 039 T027-T028: Use workspace assignment service
from .services import get_workspace_assigner

assigner = get_workspace_assigner()
assignment = await assigner.assign_workspace(...)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Full 4-tier priority system
- ✅ Modular, testable code
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ App-specific handler support

### T033-T035: Testing & Validation

1. **T033**: Run full test suite → Verify all tests pass
2. **T034**: Re-run audit tools → Confirm still zero duplicates
3. **T035**: Measure performance → Verify <100ms latency

## Final Verification Summary

| Task | Description | Status | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **T029** | Identify duplicate event processing | ✅ COMPLETE | 0 duplicates found |
| **T030** | Remove polling-based code | ✅ COMPLETE | Nothing to remove |
| **T031** | Identify conflicting filter APIs | ✅ COMPLETE | 0 conflicts found |
| **T032** | Consolidate filter APIs | ✅ COMPLETE | Nothing to consolidate |

**Overall**: ✅ **ALL VERIFICATION TASKS COMPLETE**

**Code Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Clean event-driven architecture with single implementations

**Next Steps**:
1. Update call sites to use new workspace_assigner service (T028)
2. Run test suite (T033)
3. Final audit and performance measurement (T034-T035)
