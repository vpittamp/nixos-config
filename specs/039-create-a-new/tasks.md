### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services (Foundational phase)
- Services before handlers
- Core implementation before integration
- Story validation before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T005-T012 (all Pydantic models) can run in parallel, then T013 (schema generation), then T014-T016 (fixtures) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US7)**: T017-T018 (audit scripts) can run in parallel, T021-T024 (tests) can run in parallel after code audit

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T036-T038 (tests) can run in parallel, T039 can start immediately after foundational

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T047-T049 (tests) can run in parallel, T050-T051 (window_identifier.py core functions) can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US1)**: T057-T059 (tests) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (US4)**: T067-T069 (tests) can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (US5)**: T076-T078 (tests) can run in parallel, T079-T080 (PWA detection) can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (US6)**: T084-T086 (tests) can run in parallel, T087-T092 (all RPC methods) can run in parallel, T093-T096 (all CLI commands) can run in parallel, T097-T099 (all display modules) can run in parallel

**Phase 10 (Polish)**: T105-T108 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Event Detection)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create event subscription test in tests/i3-project-daemon/integration/test_i3_connection.py"
Task: "Create event ordering test in tests/i3-project-daemon/unit/test_event_processor.py"
Task: "Create event latency test in tests/i3-project-daemon/scenarios/test_event_latency.py"

# After tests written, start event_processor.py implementation:
Task: "Create event_processor.py service at home-modules/desktop/i3-project-event-daemon/services/event_processor.py"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 6 (Diagnostic Tooling)

```bash
# Launch all RPC methods together (different functions in same file):
Task: "Implement health_check() in ipc_server.py"
Task: "Implement get_window_identity() in ipc_server.py"
Task: "Implement get_workspace_rule() in ipc_server.py"
Task: "Implement validate_state() in ipc_server.py"
Task: "Implement get_recent_events() in ipc_server.py"

# Launch all CLI commands together (different files):
Task: "Create health_check.py command"
Task: "Create window_inspect.py command"
Task: "Create event_trace.py command"
Task: "Create state_validate.py command"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Critical First Steps (Must Be Sequential)

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T004)
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (T005-T016) - BLOCKS everything
3. **Phase 3: US7 Code Consolidation** (T017-T035) - MUST complete before other stories

### After US7 Completion - MVP Path (Sequential by Priority)

1. **Phase 4: US2 Event Detection** (P1) ‚Üí Test event processing works
2. **Phase 5: US3 Class Normalization** (P2) ‚Üí Test window matching works
3. **Phase 6: US1 Workspace Assignment** (P1) ‚Üí Test core functionality works
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Core MVP complete - workspace assignment works end-to-end

### Extended Features (Can Add Incrementally)

5. **Phase 7: US4 Terminal Differentiation** (P2) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. **Phase 8: US5 PWA Identification** (P3) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. **Phase 9: US6 Diagnostic Tooling** (P2) ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. **Phase 10: Polish** ‚Üí Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after US7 completion:

1. **Team completes US7 together** (CRITICAL - establishes clean foundation)
2. **Once US7 done, parallel work begins**:
   - **Developer A**: US2 Event Detection (no dependencies)
   - **Developer B**: US3 Class Normalization (no dependencies)
   - **Developer C**: Write comprehensive tests for US1
3. **After US2 and US3 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: US1 Workspace Assignment (needs US2 + US3)
   - **Developer B**: US5 PWA Identification (needs US3)
4. **After US1 complete**:
   - **Developer A**: US4 Terminal Differentiation (needs US1)
5. **After all stories complete**:
   - **Developer C**: US6 Diagnostic Tooling (needs complete system)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or independent functions, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label** = maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent testing
- **US7 (Code Consolidation)** is CRITICAL first step - establishes clean codebase foundation per Principle XII
- **Tests before implementation** - TDD approach ensures regression safety, especially for US7 consolidation
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD red-green-refactor)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Performance targets**: <50ms event detection (SC-001), <100ms workspace assignment (SC-002), <5s diagnostic commands, 90%+ test coverage (SC-021)
- **Constitution compliance**: Forward-Only Development (Principle XII) - zero backward compatibility, complete legacy removal
- **Success validation**: Zero duplicates (SC-018), zero conflicts (SC-019), 100% tests pass (SC-022)
