# Stage all changes
git add .

# Create commit
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(039): Add comprehensive diagnostic tooling for i3 project management

Implements Feature 039 - i3 Window Management System Diagnostic & Optimization

## Changes

### New Diagnostic CLI (i3pm-diagnose)
- health: Daemon health and event subscription status
- window: Window property inspection with PWA detection
- events: Event history with live streaming support
- validate: State consistency validation (daemon vs i3)

### Daemon Enhancements
- 6 new JSON-RPC methods for diagnostic introspection
- PWA identification (Firefox FFPWA-*, Chrome PWAs)
- State validation with drift detection
- Explicit socket permissions (0600) for security

### Testing & Tooling
- 370+ lines of quickstart scenario tests
- 280+ lines of integration workflow tests
- Performance benchmark script (latency, uptime)
- Code coverage reporting script (90%+ target)
- Security review documentation

### Documentation
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md diagnostic section
- Security warnings in quickstart.md
- Troubleshooting workflows and examples
- Performance targets and exit codes

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: window identification, PWA detection, normalization
- Integration tests: daemon IPC, CLI commands, full workflow
- Scenario tests: 4 quickstart scenarios, 10 diagnostic scenarios
- Total: ~6,000 lines of tests

## Performance
- Event detection: <50ms target
- Workspace assignment: <100ms target
- Diagnostic commands: <5s target
- Daemon uptime: 99.9% target

## Security
- Socket permissions: Explicit 0600 (user-only)
- /proc access: Filtered to I3PM_* variables only
- Information disclosure: User awareness documented
- Overall risk: LOW (approved for deployment)

## Deployment Requirements
- NixOS rebuild to install pytest and package diagnostic CLI
- Daemon restart to apply socket permission fix
- Test suite execution to verify functionality

### Step 4: Build NixOS Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: This step installs dependencies and packages the diagnostic CLI.

```bash
# Test build (dry-run)
sudo nixos-rebuild dry-build --flake .#hetzner

# Check for errors in build output
# Expected: No errors, diagnostic CLI should be built

# Apply configuration (actual deployment)
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner
```

**What this does**:
- Installs pytest and pytest-asyncio (for running tests)
- Packages i3pm-diagnostic CLI tool
- Applies socket permission fix to running daemon (requires restart)

### Step 5: Restart Daemon

Restart the daemon to apply socket permission fix:

```bash
# Restart daemon
systemctl --user restart i3-project-event-listener

# Wait for startup
sleep 3

# Verify daemon is running
systemctl --user status i3-project-event-listener

# Expected: Active (running), no errors in recent logs
```

### Step 6: Verify Installation

Verify diagnostic CLI is installed:

```bash
# Check if command is available
which i3pm-diagnose

# Expected: /nix/store/.../bin/i3pm-diagnose

# Test help output
i3pm-diagnose --help

# Expected: Usage information for health, window, events, validate commands
```

### Step 7: Smoke Test

Run basic diagnostic commands to verify functionality:

```bash
# Test 1: Health check
i3pm-diagnose health

# Expected output:
# - Daemon version and uptime
# - i3 IPC connected: âœ“
# - Event subscriptions: 4/4 active
# - Overall status: HEALTHY

# Test 2: Recent events
i3pm-diagnose events --limit 10

# Expected: Table of recent events with timestamps

# Test 3: State validation
i3pm-diagnose validate

# Expected: Consistency percentage (should be >95%)

# Test 4: JSON output
i3pm-diagnose health --json | jq .

# Expected: Valid JSON with health_data structure
```

### Step 8: Verify Socket Permissions

**Security verification** - Ensure socket has correct permissions:

```bash
# Check socket permissions
ls -la ~/.cache/i3-project-daemon/ipc.sock

# Expected output:
# srwx------ (0600) - user-only access

# Check directory permissions
ls -ld ~/.cache/i3-project-daemon/

# Expected output:
# drwx------ (0700) - user-only access

# Verify other users cannot access
sudo -u nobody ls -la ~/.cache/i3-project-daemon/ipc.sock 2>&1 | grep "Permission denied"

# Expected: Permission denied error
```

---

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Run Full Test Suite

Execute comprehensive test suite to verify all functionality:

```bash
# Navigate to repo root
cd /etc/nixos

# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/i3-project-daemon/ -v

# Expected: All tests pass (or skip if daemon not running)
# Target: 90%+ pass rate

# Run specific test suites
python3 -m pytest tests/i3-project-daemon/scenarios/test_quickstart_scenarios.py -v
python3 -m pytest tests/i3-project-daemon/integration/test_full_diagnostic_workflow.py -v
```

### Generate Code Coverage Report

Verify test coverage meets 90%+ target:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
./scripts/generate-coverage-report.sh

# Expected:
# - HTML report at .coverage-report/html/index.html
# - Overall coverage: 90%+
# - Exit code: 0 (success)

# View HTML report
xdg-open .coverage-report/html/index.html
```

### Run Performance Benchmarks

Verify performance targets are met:

```bash
# Run benchmark script
python3 scripts/benchmark-performance.py

# Expected output:
# - health_check: <50ms (P95)
# - get_window_identity: <50ms (P95)
# - validate_state: <50ms (P95)
# - get_recent_events: <100ms (P95)
# - Overall: âœ… ALL PERFORMANCE TARGETS MET

# JSON output for CI
python3 scripts/benchmark-performance.py --json > benchmark-results.json
```

### User Acceptance Testing

Test diagnostic commands with real scenarios:

```bash
# Scenario 1: Health check
i3pm-diagnose health
# Verify: Shows healthy status

# Scenario 2: Create window and inspect it
# (Open a new terminal window)
# Get window ID from i3-msg
WINDOW_ID=$(i3-msg -t get_tree | jq '.. | select(.focused? == true) | .id')
i3pm-diagnose window $WINDOW_ID
# Verify: Shows window properties, I3PM env, project association

# Scenario 3: Monitor events in real-time
i3pm-diagnose events --follow &
# (Create/close windows, switch workspaces)
# Verify: Events appear in real-time
# Ctrl+C to stop

# Scenario 4: Validate state
i3pm-diagnose validate
# Verify: Shows consistency percentage, any mismatches
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered during deployment:

### Rollback Steps

1. **Revert Git Commit**:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git commit -m "Revert Feature 039 deployment"
   ```

2. **Rebuild NixOS**:
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner
   ```

3. **Restart Daemon**:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart i3-project-event-listener
   ```

4. **Verify Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Diagnostic command should not exist
   which i3pm-diagnose
   # Expected: Command not found

   # Daemon should still work
   systemctl --user status i3-project-event-listener
   # Expected: Active (running)
   ```

### Known Issues & Workarounds

**Issue**: pytest not installed after rebuild
- **Workaround**: Install manually with `pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov`

**Issue**: Diagnostic CLI not found
- **Workaround**: Check if `home-modules/tools/i3pm-diagnostic/default.nix` is included in home-manager configuration

**Issue**: Socket permissions revert after daemon restart
- **Workaround**: Verify ipc_server.py changes were applied correctly
