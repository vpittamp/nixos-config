## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Mentions i3 IPC protocol and systemd as constraints, but doesn't specify implementation languages or frameworks. Technical Constraints appropriately define boundaries without prescribing implementation.

✅ **User value focused**: All 4 user stories explain why the priority matters and how it benefits users:
- P1: Real-time state updates (eliminates race conditions)
- P2: Automatic window tracking (instant detection)
- P2: Application workspace distinction (proper workspace isolation)
- P3: Workspace state monitoring (multi-monitor support)

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in terms of user actions and system behaviors (e.g., "lazygit opens in dedicated workspace", "status bar updates instantly"), not code structures or algorithms.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios (4 stories with 6 acceptance scenarios each), Requirements (44 FRs in 6 categories), Success Criteria (16 total: 11 quantitative + 5 qualitative), Key Entities (6 entities), Edge Cases (10 scenarios), Assumptions (10), Out of Scope (7 items), Dependencies, and Risks all present and comprehensive.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers**: All requirements are concrete with detailed solutions provided in edge cases section. Application identification ambiguities addressed through hierarchical strategy (WM_INSTANCE → WM_CLASS → title → process → fallback).

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each of 44 FRs includes specific, verifiable criteria:
- FR-001: Socket path from specific sources
- FR-010: Processing within 100ms
- FR-027: <5MB memory during idle
- FR-035-044: Application identification hierarchy and workspace assignment rules
- All requirements include measurable or observable outcomes

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 11 quantitative SC entries include specific metrics:
- SC-001: 200ms project switch completion
- SC-002: 200ms window detection
- SC-005: 7+ days uptime, <10MB memory
- SC-009: 100% terminal app identification accuracy
- SC-010: 100% PWA distinction accuracy
- SC-011: Correct workspace labels (application ID vs base class)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: SC focuses on user-observable outcomes without implementation exposure:
- "Terminal-based applications launched via desktop files are correctly identified" (not "Python daemon marks windows using WM_INSTANCE")
- "Workspace labels correctly reflect application identifiers" (not "i3wsr uses daemon IPC to fetch app names")
- "Users perceive project switching as instantaneous" (qualitative UX outcome)

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 4 user stories includes 4-6 Given/When/Then scenarios:
- User Story 1: 4 scenarios (project switch, rapid switching, window hiding, i3 restart)
- User Story 2: 4 scenarios (window marking, simultaneous windows, workspace moves, manual marks)
- User Story 3: 4 scenarios (monitor disconnect, workspace creation, workspace destruction, workspace renaming)
- User Story 4: 6 scenarios (lazygit launch, PWA launch, terminal distinction, Firefox/PWA separation, app relaunching, multiple PWAs)

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 comprehensive edge cases documented with expected behaviors:
1. i3 IPC socket unavailability (auto-reconnect, status indicator)
2. Event subscription failures (exponential backoff, polling fallback)
3. Simultaneous window creation (sequential processing, atomic writes)
4. Out-of-order events (timestamp-based discard, idempotent updates)
5. Manual mark changes (binding::run event detection, visibility updates)
6. Rapid project switching (debouncing, final state optimization)
7. **Terminal app distinction** (WM_INSTANCE/title/process, desktop file metadata, fallback strategy)
8. **PWA distinction** (WM_INSTANCE priority, title matching, Firefox separation)
9. **Direct terminal app launch** (title/process identification, fallback to generic)
10. **Identical PWA properties** (title as secondary, desktop file validation, manual marking)

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 7 items:
1. Multi-user support
2. Remote i3 instances (TCP)
3. Event replay from logs
4. Custom event types beyond i3
5. Window content inspection
6. Backward compatibility with existing system
7. Automated migration tooling

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**:
- **10 assumptions documented**: i3 IPC stability, event ordering, single i3 instance, UNIX socket reliability, event completeness, greenfield implementation, window properties availability, desktop file metadata, unique identifiers, i3wsr integration
- **4 dependencies listed**: i3 v4.20+, systemd, modern scripting language with JSON/async, no file-based state sync
- **10 technical constraints**: i3 IPC protocol adherence, language choice, i3 version, systemd service, event-driven architecture, mark-based tracking, home-manager deployment, unprivileged execution, auto-start, crash recovery

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 44 FRs testable with success criteria:
- FR-001 to FR-005: Connection management → SC-004 (reconnect within 500ms)
- FR-006 to FR-010: Window events → SC-002 (200ms detection), SC-006 (100% processing)
- FR-011 to FR-014: Workspace events → SC-008 (1s monitor handling)
- FR-015 to FR-019: Project switching → SC-001 (200ms switch), SC-003 (zero race conditions), SC-007 (status bar accuracy)
- FR-020 to FR-023: State management → SC-005 (7+ days uptime, <10MB memory)
- FR-024 to FR-026: Configuration & API → SC-013 (deterministic behavior)
- FR-027 to FR-031: Performance → SC-005, SC-006 (memory limits, event throughput)
- FR-032 to FR-034: Testing → SC-014 (error clarity)
- FR-035 to FR-044: **Application distinction** → SC-009 (100% terminal app ID), SC-010 (100% PWA distinction), SC-011 (correct workspace labels), SC-015 (user distinction clarity), SC-016 (consistent launch methods)

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 4 prioritized user stories provide comprehensive coverage:
1. **P1 - Real-time state updates**: Core reliability (instant status bar, no race conditions, i3 restart recovery)
2. **P2 - Automatic window tracking**: Performance improvement (eliminates 0.5-10s polling delay)
3. **P2 - Application workspace distinction**: Workflow organization (lazygit ≠ terminal, ArgoCD ≠ Firefox)
4. **P3 - Workspace monitoring**: Multi-monitor support (automatic reassignment, workspace lifecycle)

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 16 success criteria (11 quantitative, 5 qualitative) provide clear validation:
- **Quantitative**: Response times (200ms, 100ms, 500ms), uptime (7+ days), memory (<10MB), accuracy (100%), throughput (50 events/s)
- **Qualitative**: Perceived instantaneousness, predictable behavior, clear errors, application distinction clarity, launch method consistency

✅ **No implementation leaks**: Spec avoids code structures, databases, or implementation patterns. Technical Constraints define platform requirements (i3 IPC, systemd, language capabilities) without dictating architecture. Application identification requirements specify WHAT to identify (terminal apps, PWAs) and HOW to prioritize (WM_INSTANCE → title → process) without prescribing data structures or algorithms.

## Application Workspace Distinction Review (New Requirement)

### Integration Quality

✅ **User Story 4 added**: Comprehensive coverage of terminal-based apps and PWAs with 6 acceptance scenarios.

✅ **Edge cases extended**: 4 new edge cases address identification ambiguities:
- Missing window properties (fallback hierarchy)
- PWA vs Firefox separation (WM_INSTANCE priority)
- Direct launch without desktop files (title/process matching)
- Identical PWA properties (title as secondary identifier)

✅ **Functional requirements extended**: FR-035 to FR-044 provide 10 new requirements covering:
- Identification strategy (WM_INSTANCE → WM_CLASS → title → process)
- Desktop file metadata support (StartupWMClass)
- Workspace assignment based on app identifier (not base class)
- Workspace naming integration (i3wsr)
- Prevention of incorrect grouping (lazygit ≠ ghostty, ArgoCD ≠ Firefox)

✅ **Success criteria extended**: SC-009 to SC-011, SC-015 to SC-016 provide 5 new metrics:
- 100% terminal app identification accuracy
- 100% PWA distinction accuracy
- Correct workspace labels (app ID vs base class)
- User distinction clarity
- Launch method consistency

✅ **Key entities extended**: 2 new entities defined:
- Application Identifier (name, matching rules, workspace, desktop file)
- Application Identification Rules (priority, property type, pattern, hierarchy)

✅ **Assumptions extended**: 3 new assumptions added:
- Window properties available at creation time (X11/Wayland standard)
- Desktop file metadata declarations (StartupWMClass)
- Unique identifiers determinable via property combinations
- i3wsr can use daemon-provided app identifiers

✅ **Risks extended**: 4 new risks identified with mitigations:
- Application identification failure → Fallback hierarchy + manual override
- Missing desktop file metadata → Templates + documentation
- Identical PWA properties → Title as secondary + requirements doc
- Window properties changing post-creation → Title change event re-evaluation

### Coherence with Original Feature

✅ **Complementary**: Application distinction enhances event-driven architecture by:
- Leveraging window::new events to identify apps instantly (vs polling window properties)
- Using i3 marks extended to include app identifiers (project:nixos + app:lazygit)
- Integrating with daemon IPC to provide app names for i3wsr workspace renaming
- Maintaining in-memory app-to-window registry alongside project-to-window registry

✅ **No conflicts**: Application distinction requirements align with:
- Event-driven design (FR-035 to FR-044 use same event subscription model as FR-006 to FR-010)
- In-memory state (app identifiers stored in daemon, not files)
- i3 marks as source of truth (app marks persist alongside project marks)
- Performance targets (identification within same 200ms window as project marking)

✅ **Scope appropriate**: Application distinction focused on:
- Terminal-based apps launched via desktop files (in scope)
- Firefox PWAs (in scope)
- Manual marking for edge cases (in scope)
- **Excludes**: Generic process monitoring, arbitrary app detection, window content analysis (out of scope)

## Notes

**Spec Quality**: Excellent. All checklist items pass. The specification is comprehensive, testable, and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization (2x P1, 2x P2, 1x P3) with rationale
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage (10 scenarios including application identification challenges)
3. Well-defined hierarchical identification strategy (WM_INSTANCE → WM_CLASS → title → process → fallback)
4. Measurable success criteria with specific performance targets (200ms, 100%, <10MB)
5. Proper scope boundaries and risk mitigation strategies
6. **New**: Application workspace distinction seamlessly integrated with event-driven architecture
7. **New**: Clear separation between terminal apps (lazygit) and base terminals (ghostty)
8. **New**: Clear separation between PWAs (ArgoCD, Backstage) and Firefox browser

**Application Distinction Integration**: The new requirement is well-integrated:
- Complements event-driven approach (uses same window::new events)
- Extends existing state management (adds app identifiers to window registry)
- Maintains architectural consistency (in-memory state, i3 marks, daemon IPC)
- Provides clear success criteria (100% identification accuracy, correct workspace labels)

**Recommendation**: ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan` command.

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
2. Research i3 window property availability (WM_INSTANCE, WM_CLASS, title timing)
3. Design application identification rules configuration format
4. Plan desktop file templates for terminal-based apps
5. Plan i3wsr integration for daemon-provided app names
