# Async Migration Checklist: i3 Event Daemon

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality for migrating i3 daemon from synchronous i3ipc to async i3ipc.aio
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Type**: Ad-hoc - Prerequisite work for Feature 015
**Scope**: Complete migration to i3ipc.aio.Connection with rigorous testing

## Context

**Problem Identified**: The daemon currently uses synchronous `i3ipc.Connection` but registers async event handlers, causing tick events and other event subscriptions to never fire. The `sync_wrapper` in `connection.py` calls `asyncio.create_task()` but i3ipc's synchronous event loop doesn't integrate with asyncio.

**Required Solution**: Migrate to `i3ipc.aio.Connection` which provides native async/await support and proper asyncio integration.

**Impact**: This blocks all event-driven functionality in Feature 015 (User Stories 1-4). Tick events don't fire, window events aren't processed, daemon appears to run but doesn't respond to i3 events.
