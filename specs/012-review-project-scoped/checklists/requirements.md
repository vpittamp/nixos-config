# Specification Quality Checklist: i3-Native Dynamic Project Workspace Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Notes

- Specification successfully eliminates static NixOS configuration in favor of runtime JSON files
- Aligns closely with i3 native features (marks, append_layout, tick events, workspace output assignments)
- Makes projects fully dynamic without requiring rebuilds
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions have reasonable defaults
