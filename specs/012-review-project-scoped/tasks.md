# Tasks: i3-Native Dynamic Project Workspace Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/etc/nixos/specs/012-review-project-scoped/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No explicit test tasks - validation will be manual testing per user story acceptance scenarios

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6, SETUP, FOUND, POLISH)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Home-manager modules: `home-modules/desktop/`, `home-modules/tools/`
- Shell scripts: `~/.config/i3/scripts/` (deployed via home-manager)
- Application launchers: `~/.config/i3/launchers/`
- Documentation: `specs/012-review-project-scoped/`

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core scripts and configuration that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 [FOUND] Create `~/.config/i3/projects/` directory structure via home-manager

- [X] T037 [P] [US3] Create polybar module script `~/.config/polybar/scripts/i3-project-indicator.py` - subscribes to i3 tick events, updates display text
- [ ] T038 [P] [US3] Update home-manager polybar configuration to include project indicator module (deferred - manual configuration)
- [ ] T039 [US3] Test workflow: switch projects, verify polybar updates within 1 second without file polling

**Checkpoint**: Polybar updates via i3 events, no polling required ‚úÖ

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - Phase 3 (US1): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - Phase 4 (US4): Can start after US1 complete (extends project-switch.sh)
  - Phase 5 (US2): Can start after US4 complete (depends on project-switch.sh enhancements)
  - Phase 6 (US3): Can start after US2 complete (depends on project-switch.sh being feature-complete)
  - Phase 7 (US5): Can start in parallel with US3/US2 (minor enhancement)
  - Phase 8 (US6): Can start after US2 complete (depends on launchers)
- **Additional Features (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1 complete (rofi), optional for MVP
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Foundation only - no other user story dependencies ‚úÖ MVP START
- **US4 (P1)**: Depends on US1 (extends project-switch.sh)
- **US2 (P1)**: Depends on US4 (needs full project-switch.sh with layout support)
- **US3 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (project-switch.sh must be feature-complete)
- **US5 (P2)**: Can start after US4 (minor enhancement to workspace assignment)
- **US6 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (requires launcher wrappers)

### Recommended Execution Order

**Strict Sequential** (safest, one developer):
1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T008) ‚ö†Ô∏è CHECKPOINT
3. Phase 3: US1 (T009-T016) ‚úÖ MVP Checkpoint - Can stop here for basic functionality
4. Phase 4: US4 (T017-T023) ‚úÖ Enhanced configuration support
5. Phase 5: US2 (T024-T034) ‚úÖ Full window management with marks
6. Phase 6: US3 (T035-T039) ‚úÖ Polybar integration
7. Phase 7: US5 (T040-T043) ‚úÖ Multi-monitor support
8. Phase 8: US6 (T044-T047) ‚úÖ Runtime app classification
9. Phase 9: Additional (T048-T052) - Rofi + migration
10. Phase 10: Polish (T053-T061)

**Parallel Opportunities** (multiple developers or task batching):

After Foundational Phase (T008 complete), can parallelize:
- Developer A: US1 (T009-T016) ‚Üí US4 (T017-T023)
- Developer B: Wait for US1 ‚Üí US2 (T024-T034) once US4 done
- Developer C: Prepare US3/US5/US6 scripts, integrate once dependencies ready

Within each phase, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel.
