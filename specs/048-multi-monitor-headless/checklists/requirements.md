# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Monitor Headless Sway/Wayland Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Details:

1. **Content Quality** - All items passed:
   - Spec uses technology-agnostic language (e.g., "virtual display" not "wlroots output")
   - Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "connect three VNC clients simultaneously")
   - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

2. **Requirement Completeness** - All items passed:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all decisions have documented assumptions)
   - Each FR is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking output count)
   - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "latency under 200ms")
   - Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., SC-001 says "connect three clients" not "spawn three wayvnc processes")
   - Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
   - Edge cases cover VNC disconnects, service failures, and resolution mismatches
   - Scope is bounded to 3 displays with clear dependencies listed
   - 10 assumptions documented with rationale

3. **Feature Readiness** - All items passed:
   - Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-002 → User Story 1 scenarios 1-3)
   - User stories prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
   - Success criteria are verifiable without knowing implementation (e.g., SC-006 uses i3pm CLI, not internal state)
   - No technical jargon that assumes implementation choices

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- Consider running `/speckit.clarify` if user wants to refine workspace distribution or resolution choices
- All 10 assumptions provide reasonable defaults but can be adjusted based on user feedback during planning
