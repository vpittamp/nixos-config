- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
This is a NixOS system integration project. All paths are in `/etc/nixos/` repository:
- **Modules**: `home-modules/desktop/i3/`, `home-modules/desktop/i3blocks/`
- **Scripts**: Generated declaratively in modules (not separate files)
- **Documentation**: `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, feature spec in `specs/014-create-a-new/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Validation Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create validation infrastructure and prepare for constitutional compliance remediation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user story validation
  - Script conversion (T004-T021) must complete before user stories can be tested
  - Cleanup tasks (T022-T029) can run in parallel with later conversion tasks
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Phase 3): Can start after T004-T010 complete
  - User Story 2 (Phase 4): Can start after T028-T029 complete
  - User Story 3 (Phase 5): Can start after T004-T021 complete
  - User Story 4 (Phase 6): Can start after T017, T022-T027 complete
  - User Story 5 (Phase 7): Can start after T012-T015 complete
  - User Story 6 (Phase 8): Can start after T016 complete
  - User Story 7 (Phase 9): Can start after Phase 2 complete (uses existing scripts)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all user stories being validated

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Requires T004-T010 (core project management scripts converted)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Requires T028-T029 (redundant state cleanup) - can run parallel to US1
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Requires T004-T021 (all scripts converted to verify i3 native usage)
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Requires T017, T022-T027 (i3blocks script + polybar cleanup)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Requires T012-T015 (launcher scripts converted) - can run parallel to US1-4
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Requires T016 (log viewer script converted) - can run parallel to US1-5
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Independent after Phase 2 - can run parallel to US5-6

### Within Each Phase

**Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- T004 must complete before T005-T021 (establishes declarative pattern)
- T005-T021 can partially parallelize (different scripts, but all modify same module file)
- T022-T027 can run in parallel with later script conversions (different files)
- T028-T029 can run in parallel after T005-T007 complete (searches converted scripts)

**User Stories**:
- Tasks within each user story are sequential (test after implementation)
- Different user stories can proceed in parallel once their foundational dependencies are met

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T001, T002, T003 can all run in parallel (different validation scripts)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T018-T021 can run in parallel (different i3blocks scripts, different sections of default.nix)
- T022-T027 can run in parallel (different cleanup tasks, different files)

**Phase 3-9 (User Stories)**:
- Once Phase 2 completes, multiple user stories can be validated in parallel
- Example: US1, US2, US4 validation can happen simultaneously after their dependencies met

**Phase 10 (Polish)**:
- T072-T075 documentation updates can run in parallel
- T076-T082 validation tests can run in parallel
- T089-T090 workflow tests can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After T004 establishes pattern, convert multiple scripts in parallel:
Task: "Convert scripts/project-create.sh to declarative generation" (T006)
Task: "Convert scripts/project-list.sh to declarative generation" (T009)
Task: "Convert scripts/project-current.sh to declarative generation" (T010)

# Cleanup tasks in parallel:
Task: "Remove polybar indicator script deployment" (T022)
Task: "Update comments in i3.nix" (T025)
Task: "Delete polybar-i3-project-indicator.py source file" (T027)
```

5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 ‚Üí Native i3 integration validated
6. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 ‚Üí Status bar integration working
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
8. Deploy/demo if ready ‚Üí Constitutional compliance achieved, core functionality validated

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Constitution compliant, scripts declarative
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Core lifecycle works (create/switch/list)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí i3 schema alignment verified
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí i3 native integration confirmed
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Status bar working (MVP complete!)

7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Logging and debugging available
8. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Multi-monitor support added
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Constitutional Compliance First Strategy

**Rationale**: Phase 2 (Foundational) fixes critical constitutional violations that affect all user stories.

**Approach**:
1. Phase 1: Create validation tools (T001-T003)
2. **Phase 2: Fix all constitutional violations (T004-T029)** ‚Üê PRIORITY
   - Convert all scripts to declarative generation
   - Standardize all binary paths
   - Remove polybar remnants
   - Clean up redundant state files
3. Phase 3+: Validate user stories using constitutionally compliant scripts

**Benefit**: Ensures all subsequent testing uses proper declarative configuration, achieving constitutional compliance before feature validation.

---

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently validatable after its dependencies complete
- **No test tasks** included - feature focuses on consolidation and validation, not test creation
- **Foundational phase is critical** - constitutional violations must be fixed before user story validation
- Commit after each major task group (script conversion batch, user story validation batch)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
- **xdotool testing**: Be careful not to close active terminal - target specific window IDs
- All timing measurements should be logged for SC-009, SC-016, SC-017 compliance verification

---

## Success Criteria Mapping

Tasks map to success criteria from spec.md:

- **SC-001**: T030-T036 (complete project lifecycle in <60s)
- **SC-002-SC-003**: T037-T041 (i3 layout JSON validation, minimal extensions)
- **SC-004-SC-007**: T042-T046 (i3 marks usage, native commands, workspace queries)
