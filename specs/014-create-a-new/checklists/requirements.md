# Specification Quality Checklist: Consolidate and Validate i3 Project Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification focuses on user workflows and system capabilities
- Uses technology-agnostic language (e.g., "window management", "status bar", not specific implementation)
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 49 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-006 can be verified by validating JSON against i3 schema, FR-032 verified by checking log file exists)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "under 60 seconds", SC-008: "within 1 second", SC-003: "fewer than 5 extension fields", SC-015: "within 100ms")
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (12 scenarios listed, including logging edge cases)
- Dependencies clearly listed (i3, i3blocks, jq, rofi, xdotool, bash, NixOS)
- Assumptions documented (11 assumptions about system configuration)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- 7 user stories with priorities (P1-P3) and acceptance scenarios
- Each user story has specific "Given/When/Then" acceptance criteria
- Success criteria map to user stories (SC-001 covers P1 lifecycle, SC-002-SC-007 cover P1 schema alignment, SC-008 covers P1 status bar, SC-015-SC-020 cover P2 logging)
- No Bash, Nix, or implementation details in spec (appropriate for requirements document)
- **NEW**: Added P1 user story for i3 JSON schema alignment per user request
- **NEW**: Added P2 user story for real-time event logging and debugging per user request

## Notes

âœ… **Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`**

This specification successfully consolidates the functionality from features 012 and 013 with a strong emphasis on i3 JSON schema alignment. All requirements are clear, testable, and technology-agnostic. The user scenarios provide complete coverage of the integrated system's capabilities.

Key strengths:
- **i3 JSON schema alignment as a first-class requirement**: New user story (P1) and dedicated functional requirements section (FR-006 through FR-013) ensure project state uses i3's native schema
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear integration points between project management and status bar
- Detailed testing strategy that preserves active terminal session
- Well-defined success criteria with specific, measurable outcomes
- Minimal custom state files - i3 tree state is the primary source of truth

Key updates from user feedback:

**i3 JSON Schema Alignment:**
- Added User Story 2 (P1): "i3 JSON Schema Alignment for Project State"
- Added 8 new functional requirements (FR-006 through FR-013) focused on schema alignment
- Added FR-020: Query i3 state directly via IPC rather than maintaining separate state files
- Updated Key Entities to emphasize i3 Tree State as authoritative source
- Added success criteria SC-002, SC-003, SC-007, SC-014 for schema validation

**Logging and Debugging:**
- Added User Story 6 (P2): "Real-Time Event Logging and Debugging"
- Added 10 new functional requirements (FR-032 through FR-041) for centralized logging
- Added FR-035: Subscribe to i3 events (workspace, window, binding) via IPC and log them
- Added 4 new Key Entities: Log File, Event Subscriber, Log Viewer Tool, Debug Mode
- Added 6 success criteria (SC-015 through SC-020) for logging validation
- Added 4 logging-related edge cases (log rotation, file deletion, concurrent ops, debug overhead)
- Log format: `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [COMPONENT] MESSAGE` with 10MB rotation, 5 file retention

**Requirements Summary:**
- Total: 49 functional requirements (up from 32 original)
- Total: 20 success criteria (up from 10 original)
- Total: 7 user stories (up from 5 original)
- Total: 12 edge cases (up from 8 original)
