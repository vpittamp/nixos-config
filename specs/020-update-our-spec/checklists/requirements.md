# Specification Quality Checklist: App Discovery & Auto-Classification System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ PASSED - All Checklist Items

**Content Quality Review**:
- ✅ Specification uses technology-agnostic language throughout
- ✅ Focus is on user workflows and value delivery (pattern rules reduce manual work, wizard improves onboarding, inspector enables troubleshooting)
- ✅ All sections use non-technical terminology (scoped/global instead of class matching algorithms, wizard instead of TUI implementation)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements fully specified
- ✅ All 63 functional requirements (FR-073 through FR-135) are testable with measurable outcomes
- ✅ All 20 success criteria (SC-021 through SC-040) specify measurable targets (time thresholds, percentages, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria use user-facing language (no mention of Python, Textual, fnmatch, or implementation tools)
- ✅ All 4 user stories include acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 10 edge cases identified with specific system responses
- ✅ Scope bounded by 4 enhancements with clear priority ordering (P1 patterns → P2 detection/wizard → P3 inspector)
- ✅ 10 assumptions documented addressing Xvfb availability, X11 vs Wayland, file system atomicity, daemon responsiveness

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- ✅ Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories (e.g., FR-073 to FR-082 test pattern workflows in Story 1)
- ✅ User scenarios independently testable (pattern creation, detection, wizard classification, window inspection each deliverable standalone)
- ✅ Success criteria verify all feature goals:
  - SC-021: Pattern creation performance
  - SC-022-SC-023: Detection and wizard completion time
  - SC-024: Inspector usability
  - SC-025-SC-027: Technical performance without exposing implementation
  - SC-028-SC-040: UX and user satisfaction metrics
- ✅ No leaked implementation details (mentions Python modules only in Assumptions section where appropriate for technical context)

## Notes

Specification is **READY FOR PLANNING** (`/speckit.plan`).

### Strengths:
1. **Clear Prioritization**: P1 patterns → P2 detection/wizard → P3 inspector creates logical implementation order
2. **Independent Testability**: Each user story can be implemented, tested, and deployed independently
3. **Comprehensive Edge Cases**: 10 edge cases with specific system responses prevent common failure modes
4. **Measurable Success**: All SC items include specific numbers (30s, 60s, 5min, <1ms, 95%, 100%) enabling objective verification
5. **Technology-Agnostic**: Spec readable by product managers and users, no Python/Textual/i3 IPC implementation details

### Areas of Excellence:
- **Precedence Rules**: FR-076 clearly specifies explicit lists > patterns > heuristics avoiding ambiguity
- **Resource Cleanup**: FR-088, FR-089 specify graceful termination (SIGTERM + SIGKILL) and comprehensive cleanup
- **Data Integrity**: FR-106, FR-119 specify atomic writes (temp file + rename) preventing corruption
- **User Guidance**: SC-036 requires 100% of errors include remediation steps ("Install with: nix-env...")
- **Performance Targets**: SC-025 (<1ms pattern matching), SC-026 (<50ms TUI), SC-027 (100% cleanup) set concrete bars

### Recommendation:
**Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan`** - No clarifications or spec updates needed.
