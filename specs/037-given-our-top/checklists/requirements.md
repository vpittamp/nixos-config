# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Project-Scoped Window Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1 MVP, P2, P3)
- Comprehensive edge case handling
- Well-defined scope with explicit "out of scope" items
- Measurable success criteria (100% correctness, <2 second performance)
- Technology-agnostic language throughout
- Strong alignment with existing Feature 035 implementation

**Dependencies Verified**:
- Feature 035 (I3PM_* variables) - ✅ Complete and verified working
- Feature 033 (workspace-monitor mapping) - ✅ Available
- Feature 034 (Walker/Elephant) - ✅ Primary launcher
- Feature 025 (Window state management) - ✅ Available

**Next Steps**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
