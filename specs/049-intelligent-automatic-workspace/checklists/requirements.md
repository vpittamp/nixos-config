# Specification Quality Checklist: Intelligent Automatic Workspace-to-Monitor Assignment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Spec focuses on behavior and outcomes, not technology choices
  - References to Sway/i3pm are contextual (existing system) not prescriptive
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - All user stories explain clear value ("never lose access", "automatically redistribute")
  - Success criteria measure user-facing outcomes
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - Plain language user stories
  - Technical terms explained in context
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - All requirements are specific and unambiguous
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - All FRs have clear verification criteria
  - Example: "MUST wait 500ms" (testable), "MUST preserve workspace numbers" (verifiable)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - All SCs include specific metrics (time, count, percentage)
  - Example: "within 1 second", "zero windows lost", "95% of events"
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - Focused on user experience, not implementation
  - Example: "Users experience automatic redistribution" not "Python script executes"
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - 4 user stories with 13 total acceptance scenarios
  - Each scenario follows Given/When/Then format
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - 7 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
  - Covers failure modes (monitor disconnect, rapid changes, overflow)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - Limited to workspace distribution and window migration
  - Explicitly excludes multi-user sessions (Assumption 10)
  - State persistence is P3 (optional)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - 11 assumptions documented
  - Dependencies on Sway, i3pm daemon, existing infrastructure
  - Legacy code removal explicitly listed

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
  - Example: FR-002 (500ms debounce) → US1 scenario 4
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - P1: Automatic distribution (core functionality)
  - P1: Window preservation (data safety)
  - P2: Built-in rules (usability)
  - P3: State persistence (power user feature)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - All 8 success criteria are independently verifiable
  - Mix of performance (SC-001, SC-006), reliability (SC-002, SC-004), usability (SC-005, SC-007)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Spec describes WHAT and WHY, not HOW
  - Dependencies section lists existing code context without prescribing implementation

## Notes

**Validation Result**: ✅ **SPEC READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, measurable, and technology-agnostic. No clarifications needed.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization (P1/P2/P3) enables incremental delivery
- Comprehensive edge case coverage prevents surprises during implementation
- Explicit legacy code removal list simplifies cleanup
- Built-in distribution rules eliminate config file dependency

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation tasks
- Or use `/speckit.clarify` if any questions arise during planning
