# Specification Quality Checklist: Replace KDE Plasma with Hyprland

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on WHAT users need (declarative desktop, application compatibility, keybinding preservation) and WHY (reproducibility, productivity, stability), without prescribing HOW to implement (no mention of specific Hyprland config syntax, file paths, or module structure).

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   - 20 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) are all testable
   - 10 success criteria with specific metrics (30 seconds boot time, 100% shortcuts, 100ms response time)
   - 7 prioritized user stories with independent acceptance scenarios
   - 7 edge cases identified
   - 10 assumptions documented, 8 out-of-scope items clearly defined

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each user story has 4-5 acceptance scenarios following Given/When/Then format
   - User stories prioritized P1-P4 covering core desktop (P1), applications (P2), keybindings (P2), system bar (P3), display (P3), screenshots (P4), notifications (P4)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "30 seconds boot time" not "Hyprland service starts in 30s")
   - Migration Strategy section provides clear phased approach for implementation

## Notes

Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase. Key strengths:
- Comprehensive user story coverage with clear priorities
- Detailed functional requirements aligned with current KDE configuration
- Measurable success criteria that can validate feature completion
- Well-defined assumptions and out-of-scope items prevent scope creep
- Phased migration strategy enables incremental testing and rollback
