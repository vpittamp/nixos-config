# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete i3pm Deno CLI with Extensible Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec appropriately describes TypeScript/Deno implementation as the feature itself, not leaked implementation. Success criteria remain technology-agnostic (user-focused outcomes, not "Deno performance").
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - User stories emphasize workflow efficiency (project switching, window visualization, configuration management)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language focuses on user capabilities and outcomes, technical details confined to requirements section
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies all present and comprehensive

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - Spec has no clarification markers, all requirements are concrete
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All 60 functional requirements specify clear, verifiable capabilities with explicit command syntax and behavior
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All 10 success criteria have specific metrics (< 5 seconds, < 20MB, < 300ms, < 100ms, < 50MB, 100% test coverage for error handling)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - SCs focus on user outcomes (workflow completion time, binary size, startup time, response latency, memory usage, error handling) not implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each of 6 user stories has 4-5 Given/When/Then scenarios (total 25 scenarios)
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 10 edge cases covering daemon unavailability, connection failures, terminal resize, malformed data, empty state, display overflow, build timing, concurrency, filesystem access, signal handling
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - In Scope and Out of Scope sections clearly define feature boundaries and explicitly exclude daemon rewrite, protocol changes, new features
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 10 assumptions and comprehensive dependency sections (external, internal, build-time, runtime)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 60 FRs map to user stories and edge cases, each testable through command execution or behavior observation
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 prioritized stories (P1-P6) cover core workflows: project switching, window visualization, configuration management, daemon monitoring, rule management, interactive dashboard
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Success criteria align with user story priorities and functional requirements
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - TypeScript/Deno is the feature being specified (CLI rewrite), not leaked implementation. Daemon remains Python (explicitly out of scope).

## Notes

- **COMPLETE**: All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- **Quality**: Specification is comprehensive with 6 independently testable user stories, 60 functional requirements organized by category, 10 measurable success criteria, and clear scope boundaries.
- **Extensibility**: CLI architecture explicitly supports future parent command namespaces beyond current requirements (project, windows, daemon, rules, monitor, app-classes).
- **No clarifications needed**: User intent is clear - full transition of Python CLI to Deno with extensible architecture, TypeScript types throughout, compiled binary for NixOS integration.
- **Completeness**: Spec covers all major Python CLI functionality identified in current `i3pm --help` output (18 commands mapped to 6 parent namespaces with subcommands).
