# Tasks: Complete i3pm Deno CLI with Extensible Architecture

**Feature**: Complete i3pm Deno CLI with Extensible Architecture
**Branch**: `027-update-the-spec`
**Input**: Design documents from `/etc/nixos/specs/027-update-the-spec/`

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: No tests requested in spec - test tasks omitted per template guidance.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- [X] T011 [P] Create ANSI formatting utilities in `src/ui/ansi.ts`: cursor control (hide/show, move up/down), screen management (clear, alternate buffer), color codes, TextEncoder/TextDecoder wrappers
- [X] T012 Create main CLI entry point in `main.ts` with parseArgs() routing: global options parsing (help, version, verbose, debug), parent command routing (project, windows, daemon, rules, monitor, app-classes), help text generation, version display

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

- [X] T038 Add i3pm package to home-manager configuration: import i3pm-deno.nix module in appropriate home-modules file, ensure binary is in home.packages
- [ ] T039 Test compiled binary: rebuild NixOS/home-manager, verify `i3pm --version` shows version 2.0.0, verify `i3pm --help` shows usage information, test all commands against running daemon (pending system rebuild)

---

## Phase 10: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T040 [P] Add comprehensive help text for all commands: implement --help flag handler in main.ts, add help text for each parent command (project, windows, daemon, rules, monitor, app-classes), add help text for each subcommand with usage examples, format help output with proper indentation and examples
- [ ] T041 [P] Implement --verbose flag support: add verbose logging to daemon client connection, log all RPC requests/responses when --verbose is enabled, log event notifications in live modes
- [ ] T042 [P] Implement --debug flag support: add debug logging for socket connection details, log Zod validation details, log terminal state changes (raw mode, alternate screen), log signal handling events
- [ ] T043 Handle all edge cases from spec.md: daemon not running error message with systemctl command, socket connection timeout with retry notification, terminal resize during live TUI (trigger redraw), malformed JSON-RPC responses (validation error message), empty window state (friendly "No windows open" message), long window titles (truncation with ellipsis at column boundary), keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) with cleanup and exit code 130, concurrent project switch requests (show queue/blocking message), non-existent project directory (warning but allow switch), project directory not accessible (warning with permission hint)
- [ ] T044 [P] Validate against quickstart.md workflows: test "Workflow 1: Start Working on a Project" (list ‚Üí switch ‚Üí current ‚Üí windows), verify completion time <5 seconds per SC-001, test "Workflow 2: Debug Window Visibility Issue" (current ‚Üí windows --live with H toggle ‚Üí rules classify ‚Üí daemon events), test "Workflow 3: Create New Project" (create ‚Üí show ‚Üí switch ‚Üí windows), verify completion time <30 seconds, test "Workflow 4: Monitor System in Real-Time" (windows --live, daemon events, monitor), verify all three modes work as expected
- [ ] T045 Performance validation: measure CLI startup time (should be <300ms per SC-003), measure project switch time (should be <2s per SC-001), measure window state query time (should be <500ms), measure live TUI update latency (should be <100ms per FR-030, SC-004), verify binary size (should be <20MB per SC-002), measure memory usage during extended live monitoring session (should be <50MB after 1 hour per SC-005)
- [ ] T046 [P] Documentation updates: update quickstart.md with actual binary installation path, update README.md with compilation and testing instructions, add troubleshooting section to README.md for common errors, document all environment variables used (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, HOME, USER), document daemon protocol version compatibility requirements

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6)
- **NixOS Integration (Phase 9)**: Depends on at least US1 (MVP) being complete, ideally all user stories
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent (uses same daemon client from Phase 2)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent (extends project.ts from US1 but separate commands)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent (new command file daemon.ts)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent (new command files rules.ts, app-classes.ts)
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent (new files monitor-dashboard.ts, monitor.ts)

### Within Each User Story

- Models/types before services (Phase 2 handles this globally)
- Services/client before commands (Phase 2 handles client)
- Commands can be implemented in any order within a story
- UI components before commands that use them

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T005-T011 all marked [P] can run in parallel after T004 completes
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: All tasks sequential (same file src/commands/project.ts)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T017, T018 can run in parallel (different UI formatter files)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: All tasks sequential (same file src/commands/project.ts)
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T028, T029 sequential (same file src/commands/daemon.ts)
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: T030-T033 can run in parallel (different commands in rules.ts), T034 parallel (different file app-classes.ts)
- **Phase 8 (US6)**: T035, T036 sequential (dashboard before command)
- **Phase 10 (Polish)**: T040, T041, T042, T044, T046 all marked [P] can run in parallel

**Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories (Phase 3-8) can start in parallel if team capacity allows**

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Window Visualization)

```bash
# After Foundational phase (Phase 2) completes, launch parallel UI formatter tasks:
Task: "Implement tree view formatter in src/ui/tree.ts" (T017)
Task: "Implement table view formatter in src/ui/table.ts" (T018)

# These work on different files and have no dependencies on each other
# Once both complete, T019-T023 can proceed sequentially
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 5 (Rules Management)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch parallel rules commands:
Task: "Implement i3pm rules list command in src/commands/rules.ts" (T030)
Task: "Implement i3pm rules classify command in src/commands/rules.ts" (T031)
Task: "Implement i3pm rules validate command in src/commands/rules.ts" (T032)
Task: "Implement i3pm rules test command in src/commands/rules.ts" (T033)
Task: "Implement i3pm app-classes command in src/commands/app-classes.ts" (T034)

# NOTE: T030-T033 are in same file but separate command functions - can be parallelized
# T034 is in different file - definitely parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Project Switching)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T012) - CRITICAL foundation
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T016) - Project context switching
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - `i3pm project list`
   - `i3pm project switch nixos`
   - `i3pm project current` (should show "nixos")
   - `i3pm project clear`
   - `i3pm project current` (should show "Global")
5. Optionally complete Phase 9 (T037-T039) to compile and deploy MVP
6. Gather feedback on core project switching workflow

**MVP Deliverable**: Fully functional project context switching CLI with 4 commands (switch, clear, current, list)

### Incremental Delivery (Add User Stories Sequentially)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo MVP!**
3. Add User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP + Window Visualization)
4. Add User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (+ Configuration Management)
5. Add User Story 4 (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (+ Daemon Monitoring)

**Each story adds value without breaking previous stories**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. **Week 2+**: Once Foundational is done, parallelize:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Project switching
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Window visualization
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Phase 6) - Daemon monitoring
3. **Week 3**: Continue parallelizing:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Configuration management
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Phase 7) - Rules management
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Phase 8) - Monitor dashboard
4. **Week 4**: Integration
   - All developers: NixOS Integration (Phase 9)
   - All developers: Polish (Phase 10) - can split parallel tasks

Stories complete and integrate independently, enabling maximum parallelization.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent code sections, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., T013-T016 for US1)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- All file paths use TypeScript/Deno conventions in `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/i3pm-deno/`
- No test tasks included as tests were not requested in feature specification
- Daemon remains unchanged - all tasks are CLI-side only
- Compilation happens in Phase 9 - can defer until multiple user stories are complete
