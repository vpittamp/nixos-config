# Tasks: Complete Walker/Elephant Launcher Functionality

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/043-get-full-functionality/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not requested in feature specification - tasks focus on validation and documentation

**Organization**: Tasks organized by validation area since this is a **configuration-only feature** with no implementation required. Research phase determined all functionality already exists.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (independent validation checks)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this validation belongs to (US1-US6)
- **[VAL]**: Validation task (not implementation)

## Important Context

**Key Finding**: All Walker/Elephant functionality is **already configured and operational** in `/etc/nixos/home-modules/desktop/walker.nix`. This feature requires **validation and documentation only**, not implementation.

From research.md:
- All 8 providers enabled (clipboard, files, websearch, calc, symbols, runner, applications, menus)
- Elephant systemd service configured with proper environment variables
- Walker config.toml and Elephant websearch.toml already generated
- i3 integration ensures DISPLAY propagation
- Project context inheritance via app-launcher-wrapper.sh (Feature 034/035)

**No code changes required** - tasks validate existing configuration meets all functional requirements.

## Phase 1: Setup & Prerequisites

**Purpose**: Ensure development environment ready for validation

- [X] T001 [P] [SETUP] Verify NixOS configuration builds successfully (`nixos-rebuild dry-build --flake .#hetzner`)
- [X] T002 [P] [SETUP] Verify home-manager configuration valid (check walker.nix loads without errors)
- [X] T003 [P] [SETUP] Confirm Walker package version ‚â•1.5 (required for X11 file provider)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Validation (Service Health)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure health checks that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: All user story validations depend on Elephant service being healthy

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - validates Elephant service health
- **User Story Validation (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase (Elephant service must be healthy)
  - User stories can be validated in parallel (different providers, independent features)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Cross-Cutting (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user story validations being complete

### User Story Dependencies

All user stories are **independent** - each can be validated separately:
- **US1 (P1)**: Application launch - Tests environment variable propagation
- **US2 (P2)**: Clipboard history - Tests clipboard provider
- **US3 (P2)**: File search - Tests file provider
- **US4 (P3)**: Web search - Tests websearch provider
- **US5 (P3)**: Calculator & symbols - Tests calc and symbols providers
- **US6 (P3)**: Shell commands - Tests runner provider

No user story depends on another - validation can proceed in any order after Foundational phase.

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup tasks** (T001-T003): All can run in parallel
- **Foundational tasks** (T004-T010): Most can run in parallel (T008 depends on T004)
- **User Story Validation**: All 6 user stories (Phase 3-8) can be validated in parallel once Foundational complete
- **Within each user story**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (independent validation checks)
- **Cross-cutting tasks** (T091-T102): Most can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Clipboard)

```bash
# These validation tasks can run in parallel (independent checks):
Task T022: "Copy multiple text snippets to clipboard using xclip"
Task T029: "Test fuzzy search within clipboard history"
Task T030: "Copy image to clipboard (screenshot), verify thumbnail appears"
Task T031: "Test clipboard history with 100+ items"

# Sequential dependencies within US2:
T022 (prepare data) ‚Üí T023 (open Walker) ‚Üí T024 (verify timing) ‚Üí T025 (verify order)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Validation Only - User Story 1)

Since all functionality already exists, "MVP" means validating the most critical feature first:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verify build works)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (verify Elephant service healthy)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (validate application launching with env context)
4. **STOP and ASSESS**: If US1 validation passes, core functionality proven working
5. Document findings and decide whether to continue validating remaining stories

### Incremental Validation

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Service health confirmed
2. Validate US1 ‚Üí Application launching works ‚Üí Document
3. Validate US2 ‚Üí Clipboard history works ‚Üí Document
4. Validate US3 ‚Üí File search works ‚Üí Document
5. Validate US4 ‚Üí Web search works ‚Üí Document
6. Validate US5 ‚Üí Calculator & symbols work ‚Üí Document
7. Validate US6 ‚Üí Shell commands work ‚Üí Document
8. Each validation confirms a distinct provider works independently

### Parallel Validation Strategy

With multiple testers or automation:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational validates (Elephant healthy):
   - Tester A: Validate User Story 1 (applications)
   - Tester B: Validate User Story 2 (clipboard)
   - Tester C: Validate User Story 3 (files)
   - Tester D: Validate User Story 4 (websearch)
   - Tester E: Validate User Story 5 (calc & symbols)
   - Tester F: Validate User Story 6 (runner)
3. All validations proceed in parallel, complete independently

---

## Validation Summary

### Total Task Count: 102 tasks

**Breakdown by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 7 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Application Launch): 11 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Clipboard): 11 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - File Search): 14 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Web Search): 10 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - Calculator & Symbols): 22 tasks (11 calc + 11 symbols)
- Phase 8 (US6 - Shell Commands): 12 tasks
- Phase 9 (Cross-Cutting): 12 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**: 68 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (66% of all tasks)

**Independent Test Criteria per Story**:
- US1: Launch VS Code, check /proc/<pid>/environ for I3PM_PROJECT_NAME
- US2: Copy 3 texts, type ":", verify all 3 appear in reverse order
- US3: Type "/walker.nix", verify file appears, press Return ‚Üí Ghostty+Neovim opens
- US4: Type "@nixos tutorial", select Google ‚Üí Firefox opens with correct URL
- US5: Type "=2+2" ‚Üí "4" appears and copies; type ".lambda" ‚Üí Œª symbol appears
- US6: Type ">notify-send 'Test'" + Return ‚Üí notification appears without terminal

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + US1 validation) = 21 tasks

**Estimated Validation Effort**:
- MVP (US1 only): ~1-2 hours
- Full validation (all 6 stories): ~4-6 hours
- Includes documentation and troubleshooting time

## Notes

- **[VAL] tasks**: Validation tasks, not implementation (all functionality already exists)
- **[P] tasks**: Can run in parallel (different providers, independent checks)
- **[Story] label**: Maps validation to specific user story for traceability
- **No implementation required**: Research confirmed all code already exists in walker.nix
- **Focus on verification**: Each task verifies a specific aspect of existing functionality
- **Document findings**: Create validation report documenting what works, what needs fixes (if any)
- **Systematic approach**: Complete validation phases sequentially or in parallel
- **Checkpoint after each story**: Validate provider works independently before moving to next

**Key Difference from Implementation Tasks**: These are **validation tasks** because:
1. Research.md confirmed all providers already enabled in configuration
2. No new code needs to be written
3. All configuration files already generated (walker.nix lines 278-415)
4. Elephant service already configured with correct environment (walker.nix lines 425-458)
5. All provider prefixes already configured (walker.nix lines 324-346)
6. All success criteria depend on testing existing functionality, not building new features
