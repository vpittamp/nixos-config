# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete Walker/Elephant Launcher Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**:
- ✅ All checklist items passed
- ✅ Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- ✅ No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and testable
- ✅ Success criteria are properly scoped (technology-agnostic, measurable, user-focused)

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: Core launching, P2: Utility features, P3: Convenience features)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (10 scenarios covering environment, service, and data edge cases)
- Well-defined success criteria with specific metrics (100% success rate, <2s startup, <200ms response times)
- Explicit assumptions documented (Walker version, X11 environment, service dependencies)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if user wants to refine any aspects)
