# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate from Polybar to i3 Native Status Bar

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All requirements are clear and testable
- Assumptions section includes specific technology choices (NixOS, i3, Catppuccin) which are appropriate for this migration context
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Edge cases are well-documented
- No clarifications needed - this is a well-defined migration task with clear existing context
- **Updated**: Added technical integration section documenting native i3 IPC integration per user request
- New functional requirements (FR-013 through FR-016) specify use of native i3 workspace state and event subscriptions
- Technical Integration Points section documents how i3bar natively synchronizes with i3 workspace state
- Project indicator integration specified using i3blocks signal-based updates
