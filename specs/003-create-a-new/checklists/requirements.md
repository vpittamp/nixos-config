# Specification Quality Checklist: MangoWC Desktop Environment for Hetzner Cloud

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](/etc/nixos/specs/003-create-a-new/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec successfully avoids implementation specifics. Technical Notes section explicitly defers technical decisions to planning phase. All user stories describe value and outcomes rather than technical solutions.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- **CLARIFICATIONS RESOLVED**: All 3 clarification questions answered by user:
  1. Session Management: Sessions persist indefinitely (Option A)
  2. Concurrent Connections: Multiple connections share same session view (Option A)
  3. Authentication: 1Password password management system (Option A)

- All requirements are clear, testable, and complete
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Users can establish connection within 30 seconds" rather than "waypipe starts in under 5 seconds")
- Assumptions section updated with user selections and clearly documents all defaults
- Out of Scope section effectively bounds the feature

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Feature is well-specified with clear user journeys prioritized by value (P1-P4). All clarifications resolved. Ready for implementation planning.

## Status Summary

**Current Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete and validated:

- ✅ All clarification questions answered
- ✅ Requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ User stories prioritized with independent test criteria
- ✅ Assumptions documented with user selections
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with dependencies identified

**Next Steps**: Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation design artifacts.
