# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic Window Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification is written in user-focused language
- No specific technologies or frameworks mentioned (uses generic terms like "i3 IPC" which is the domain standard)
- Focus is on what the system does for users, not how it's built

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- All 25 functional requirements are specific and testable
- No clarification markers present - all requirements have concrete definitions
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (500ms, 99%, 50MB, etc.)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not implementation (workspace assignment time, not code execution time)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure modes and boundary conditions
- Scope is bounded to window management, workspace assignment, and project context

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- Success criteria map directly to user story outcomes
- No implementation leakage - uses domain terminology appropriately

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization with P1 (MVP) being independently deliverable
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Technology-agnostic language throughout
- Good balance between detail and abstraction

No issues found requiring spec updates.
