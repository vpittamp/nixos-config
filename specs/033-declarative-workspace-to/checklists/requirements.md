# Specification Quality Checklist: Declarative Workspace-to-Monitor Mapping

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All items complete

**Review Notes**:
- Specification is comprehensive and well-structured
- Consolidated user stories from 6 to 4 by integrating manual operations and validation into comprehensive CLI/TUI story
- All 4 user stories have clear priorities (P1, P1, P1, P2) - higher priority overall due to CLI focus
- **62 functional requirements** organized by category:
  - Configuration File Management (7 requirements)
  - Monitor Detection and Role Assignment (5 requirements)
  - Workspace Distribution (6 requirements)
  - Runtime Workspace Movement (4 requirements)
  - Status and Monitoring (4 requirements)
  - Configuration Validation (4 requirements)
  - Event-Driven Updates (4 requirements)
  - **CLI/TUI Interface (23 requirements)** - comprehensive Deno CLI integration
  - Migration and Cleanup (5 requirements)
- **12 success criteria** with specific measurable outcomes (time-based, accuracy-based, user-facing, CLI/TUI performance)
- Success criteria are all technology-agnostic (no mention of Python, Deno internals, etc.)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover monitor disconnect/connect scenarios
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- **Forward-Only Development Principle**: Explicitly removes detect-monitors.sh bash script, replaces hardcoded logic, no backward compatibility
- Out of scope section prevents scope creep AND clearly lists removed components
- No clarifications needed - all requirements have reasonable defaults

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Forward-Only Development**:
   - **REMOVES** existing bash script implementation (detect-monitors.sh)
   - **REPLACES** hardcoded distribution rules in workspace_manager.py
   - **NO backward compatibility** - clean break for best solution
   - Default config auto-generated from current behavior on first run

2. **Comprehensive CLI/TUI Integration**:
   - All functionality accessible via `i3pm monitors` subcommand
   - 16 CLI commands covering status, config, operations, diagnostics
   - Full interactive TUI with live updates and keybindings
   - Real-time event subscriptions for responsive UI
   - JSON output for all commands (scripting support)
   - Built-in troubleshooting and diagnostic tools

3. **User Experience Focus**:
   - Live-updating dashboard (`i3pm monitors watch`)
   - Interactive TUI for workspace management (`i3pm monitors tui`)
   - Diagnostic commands for troubleshooting (`diagnose`, `debug`, `history`)
   - Config editor integration with validation
   - Dry-run mode for safe testing

**Next Steps**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
