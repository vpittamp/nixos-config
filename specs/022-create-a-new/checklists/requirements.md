- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification uses technology-agnostic language throughout. References to existing dependencies (Textual, i3ipc) are in Dependencies section only, not in requirements.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories explain "Why this priority" with clear business value (productivity, reduced support, workflow optimization).

✅ **Stakeholder-friendly**: Language is accessible. Technical terms (IPC, regex) are explained in context. No code references in requirements.

✅ **All mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present with comprehensive content.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: Spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are definitive.

✅ **Testable and unambiguous**: Every functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-030) states specific, verifiable behavior. Examples:
- FR-001: "allow users to save current window layout with user-provided name" (verifiable action)
- FR-002: "restore saved layouts... within 2 seconds" (measurable timing)
- FR-023: "display breadcrumb navigation showing current screen hierarchy" (observable UI element)

✅ **Success criteria measurable**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 30 seconds" (time measurement)
- SC-003: "60% reduction" (percentage measurement)
- SC-004: "95% of tasks" (completion rate)
- SC-008: "100% accuracy" (detection rate)

✅ **Success criteria technology-agnostic**: No mention of Python, Textual, or implementation details. Focus on user-observable outcomes:
- "Users can complete workflow" (not "Python function executes")
- "Windows appear on correct monitors" (not "xrandr command succeeds")
- "Test framework executes" (not "pytest runs")

✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: 8 user stories × 4 acceptance scenarios each = 32 total scenarios covering all primary workflows.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases documented covering error conditions, boundary cases, and degraded scenarios.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes 10 related features (remote management, cross-platform, layout sharing, etc.).

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: 6 dependencies listed (all existing), 10 assumptions documented with rationale.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 30 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories. Each requirement verifiable through at least one acceptance test.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 8 user stories cover:
1. Layout management (save/restore/delete/export)
2. Workspace-monitor configuration
3. Window classification workflow
4. Auto-launch configuration
5. Navigation improvements
6. Pattern matching
7. Testing framework
8. Monitor detection/redistribution

All critical TUI functionality gaps identified during codebase exploration are addressed.

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria provide clear targets for feature completion. No vague statements like "improved UX" - all metrics are specific and measurable.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Requirements describe WHAT (user needs) and WHY (business value), never HOW (technical approach). Implementation details reserved for planning phase.

## Notes

- **Strengths**: Comprehensive coverage of missing TUI functionality based on actual codebase analysis. Clear prioritization (3× P1, 3× P2, 2× P3) enables incremental delivery.

- **Validation approach**: Specification was derived from:
  1. Analysis of existing TUI screens showing "not yet implemented" features
  2. Comparison of CLI commands (16 total) vs TUI coverage
  3. Review of data models (Project, AutoLaunchApp, WorkspacePreference) with no TUI editors
  4. Identification of testing gap (zero test files found)

- **Ready for next phase**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items satisfied. Specification is ready for planning phase.
