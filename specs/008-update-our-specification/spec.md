# Feature Specification: i3wm Configuration Consolidation & Learned Preferences

**Feature Branch**: `008-update-our-specification`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Documentation
**Input**: Update specification to reflect learned preferences through implementation of Feature 007

## Overview

This specification consolidates the learnings from Feature 007 (i3wm setup with Alacritty, Clipcat, and Web Apps) and documents the production-ready configuration preferences discovered through implementation and testing.

## Learned Preferences & Decisions

### PWA Solution: Firefox PWA (Production Choice)

**Decision**: Use Firefox PWA (`firefoxpwa`) as the primary PWA solution instead of Chromium web apps.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ **Native 1Password Support**: System-level native messaging host configuration works reliably
- ✅ **Automatic Extension Installation**: Extensions install automatically via runtime.json
- ✅ **Mature Ecosystem**: Dedicated firefoxpwa tool with proper PWA manifest support
- ✅ **Declarative Configuration**: Well-structured Nix configuration with auto-install scripts
- ✅ **Proven Reliability**: 14 PWAs running successfully on production system

**Chromium Alternative Rejected**:
- ❌ Complex symlink setup required for 1Password integration
- ❌ Unreliable authentication persistence
- ❌ Manual extension configuration needed
- ❌ Less mature PWA support (app mode, not true PWA)

**Configuration Files**:
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/firefox-pwas-declarative.nix` (ACTIVE)
- `/etc/nixos/modules/desktop/firefox-pwa-1password.nix` (ACTIVE)
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/web-apps-declarative.nix` (DISABLED)
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/web-apps-sites.nix` (DISABLED)

### Rofi Configuration: Centered with Icons

**Decision**: Rofi launcher configured with centered layout, icons enabled, 50% width.

**Configuration** (`~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`):
```rasi
configuration {
    modi: "drun,run,window";
    show-icons: true;
    display-drun: "";
    display-run: "";
    display-window: "";
}

window {
    location: center;
    anchor: center;
    width: 50%;
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Better visual appearance with application icons
- Centered position is more ergonomic for remote desktop use
- 50% width balances visibility with screen real estate
- Icons help with quick application identification

### Alt Key Alternatives for RDP Compatibility

**Decision**: All critical i3 keybindings must have Alt key alternatives.

**Rationale**: RDP clients (Windows RDP, macOS RDP, etc.) intercept the Super/Windows key before it reaches the remote i3 session, making Super-based keybindings unreliable.

**Implemented Alternatives**:
- `Alt+Return`: Launch terminal (alternative to `Super+Return`)
- `Alt+d`: Launch rofi (alternative to `Super+d`)
- `Alt+Shift+q`: Close window (alternative to `Super+Shift+q`)
- `Alt+F4`: Close window (traditional shortcut)
- `Alt+Shift+e`: Exit i3 (alternative to `Super+Shift+e`)

**Configuration Location**: `~/.config/i3/config`

### XRDP Keyboard Fixes

**Decision**: Use `~/.xsessionrc` to reset keyboard state on XRDP session start.

**Problem**: XRDP has a known bug where caps lock state gets stuck on, causing all typing to appear in capitals despite LED showing off.

**Solution** (`~/.xsessionrc`):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fix keyboard BEFORE any X session starts
setxkbmap -option
setxkbmap -option caps:none
setxkbmap us
xset -r 66
```

**Additional Fix** (`~/.xsession-fixes`):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runtime keyboard fixes
setxkbmap -option
setxkbmap -option caps:none
setxkbmap us
xset -r 66
```

**i3 Config Integration**:
```
exec --no-startup-id ~/.xsession-fixes
```

### Full Path Requirements for i3 Keybindings

**Decision**: Always use absolute paths in i3 keybindings, never relative paths.

**Rationale**: i3 keybindings don't inherit the user's full PATH environment, causing commands to fail if specified without absolute paths.

**Pattern**:
```
# ❌ WRONG: Relative path
bindsym $mod+Return exec alacritty

# ✅ CORRECT: Absolute path
bindsym $mod+Return exec /run/current-system/sw/bin/alacritty
```

**Implementation**: All keybindings in `~/.config/i3/config` use full paths from `/run/current-system/sw/bin/`.

### i3 Status Bar Management

**Decision**: Let i3 manage i3bar automatically from config, don't use separate autostart scripts.

**Problem**: Running i3bar from both i3 config and autostart script causes duplicate status bars.

**Solution**:
- Define bar in i3 config with explicit ID
- Disable any autostart scripts that launch i3bar
- Let i3's built-in bar management handle startup

**Configuration**:
```
bar {
  id bar-0
  status_command /nix/store/.../bin/i3status
  position bottom
}
```

### Manual i3 Config vs Home-Manager

**Decision**: Use manual `~/.config/i3/config` file instead of home-manager i3 module.

**Rationale**:
- home-manager's `xsession.windowManager.i3` only works with X session startup
- XRDP doesn't use standard X session startup process
- Manual config file is more reliable for XRDP environments
- Can use full nix store paths directly

**Implementation**: Manual config file at `~/.config/i3/config` with full paths.

## User Scenarios & Implementation Status

### User Story 1 - Launch Applications with Rofi (Priority: P1) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

User needs to quickly launch applications using keyboard shortcuts in their remote desktop i3wm session.

**Why this priority**: Core productivity functionality - users can't work without being able to launch applications.

**Independent Test**: Press `Super+d` or `Alt+d` and verify rofi launcher appears centered with icons showing available applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is logged into i3 via RDP, **When** user presses `Super+d`, **Then** rofi launcher appears centered with application icons
2. **Given** RDP client captures Super key, **When** user presses `Alt+d`, **Then** rofi launcher appears as alternative
3. **Given** rofi is open, **When** user types application name, **Then** matching applications appear with icons
4. **Given** rofi shows applications, **When** user selects one, **Then** application launches successfully

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete - Rofi configured with centered layout, icons enabled, both Super+d and Alt+d keybindings working.

### User Story 2 - Manage Windows with Keyboard (Priority: P1) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

User needs to manage windows (open terminal, close windows, navigate) using keyboard shortcuts that work reliably over RDP.

**Why this priority**: Core window management is essential for tiling window manager productivity.

**Independent Test**: Open terminal with `Alt+Return`, close with `Alt+Shift+q`, and verify keybindings work over RDP.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is in i3, **When** user presses `Alt+Return`, **Then** Alacritty terminal opens
2. **Given** window is focused, **When** user presses `Alt+Shift+q`, **Then** window closes
3. **Given** window is focused, **When** user presses `Alt+F4`, **Then** window closes (traditional shortcut)
4. **Given** multiple windows open, **When** user presses `Alt+Shift+e`, **Then** i3 exits gracefully

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete - All window management keybindings have Alt alternatives, tested working over RDP.

---

### User Story 3 - Clipboard History Management (Priority: P2) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

User needs to access clipboard history to retrieve previously copied content without switching to a separate application.

**Why this priority**: Enhances productivity by providing clipboard history, but not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Copy multiple items, press `Super+v`, and verify clipboard menu shows history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has copied multiple items, **When** user presses `Super+v`, **Then** clipcat menu shows clipboard history
2. **Given** clipboard menu is open, **When** user selects item, **Then** item is pasted at cursor
3. **Given** clipboard contains sensitive data, **When** user presses `Super+Shift+v`, **Then** clipboard is cleared

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete - Clipcat integrated with Super+v keybinding, working in X11/XRDP environment.

---

### User Story 4 - GPU-Accelerated Terminal (Priority: P2) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

User needs a fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that starts quickly and renders smoothly.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience but not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Launch Alacritty with `Alt+Return` and verify smooth scrolling and fast startup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user needs terminal, **When** user presses `Alt+Return`, **Then** Alacritty launches in under 1 second
2. **Given** Alacritty is running, **When** user scrolls through long output, **Then** scrolling is smooth (GPU-accelerated)
3. **Given** user wants floating terminal, **When** user presses `Super+Shift+Return`, **Then** floating Alacritty window opens

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete - Alacritty configured as default terminal with GPU acceleration, Alt+Return keybinding working.

---

### User Story 5 - Web Applications as Standalone Apps (Priority: P2) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

User needs to access web applications (GitHub, ChatGPT, Azure Portal, etc.) as standalone applications with proper window integration.

**Why this priority**: Enhances productivity by treating web apps like native apps, but not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Launch any Firefox PWA and verify it opens as standalone window with proper icon and workspace assignment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Firefox PWAs are configured, **When** user launches PWA from rofi, **Then** PWA opens as standalone window
2. **Given** PWA requires authentication, **When** user clicks 1Password icon, **Then** 1Password fills credentials automatically
3. **Given** PWA is assigned workspace, **When** PWA launches, **Then** i3 moves PWA to assigned workspace
4. **Given** PWA is running, **When** user views taskbar, **Then** PWA shows with correct icon

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete - 14 Firefox PWAs running successfully with reliable 1Password integration, workspace assignments working.

---

### User Story 6 - XRDP Keyboard Reliability (Priority: P1) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

User needs keyboard to work correctly on XRDP login without caps lock stuck on or keys not responding.

**Why this priority**: Critical - user can't type or use shortcuts if keyboard is broken.

**Independent Test**: Connect via RDP, verify typing works normally without caps lock stuck and keybindings respond.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user connects via RDP, **When** session starts, **Then** keyboard state is reset correctly
2. **Given** user starts typing, **When** user types lowercase, **Then** lowercase appears (not all caps)
3. **Given** user presses keybinding, **When** user presses `Alt+d`, **Then** rofi launches immediately
4. **Given** caps lock bug occurs, **When** user reconnects RDP, **Then** keyboard reset fixes issue

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete - `~/.xsessionrc` and `~/.xsession-fixes` scripts reset keyboard state, XRDP caps lock bug resolved.

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when RDP client doesn't support Alt key?**: User can still use traditional shortcuts like `Alt+F4` for closing windows, and can configure custom RDP client key mappings.
- **What happens when Firefox PWA profile is corrupted?**: User can run `pwa-install-all` to reinstall all PWAs with fresh profiles.
- **What happens when i3 config has syntax error?**: i3 falls back to default config and logs error to `~/.xsession-errors`.
- **What happens when rofi config is missing?**: Rofi falls back to default appearance (top bar, no icons).
- **What happens when clipcat service crashes?**: Clipboard history is lost but basic clipboard (Ctrl+C/V) still works, service can be restarted with `systemctl --user restart clipcat`.

**Build Command**: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hetzner`

### Active Modules

**Desktop**:
- `/etc/nixos/modules/desktop/i3wm.nix` - System-level i3wm setup
- `/etc/nixos/modules/desktop/xrdp.nix` - XRDP multi-session support

**Tools**:
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/firefox-pwas-declarative.nix` - Firefox PWA (ACTIVE)
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/clipcat.nix` - Clipboard manager (ACTIVE)
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/terminal/alacritty.nix` - GPU terminal (ACTIVE)
- `/etc/nixos/home-modules/tools/web-apps-declarative.nix` - Chromium web apps (DISABLED)

### Disabled Configuration

- Commented out import in `base-home.nix`

### PWA Management Commands

```bash
pwa-install-all      # Install all declared PWAs
pwa-update-panels    # Update taskbar with PWA icons
pwa-get-ids          # Get PWA IDs for permanent pinning
pwa-list             # List configured and installed PWAs
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **XRDP and home-manager incompatibility**: `xsession.windowManager.i3` only works with standard X session startup, not XRDP's session management.

2. **RDP key capture is client-specific**: Different RDP clients (Windows, macOS, Linux) handle key interception differently. Alt alternatives ensure cross-platform compatibility.

3. **Firefox PWA native messaging is more reliable**: System-level native messaging host configuration (used by Firefox) is more robust than per-profile symlink approaches (used by Chromium).

4. **i3bar duplicate instances**: Running bar from both i3 config (automatic) and autostart script (manual) causes duplicates. Let i3 manage bar lifecycle.

5. **Full paths required for keybindings**: i3 doesn't inherit full user PATH, requiring absolute paths for all commands in keybindings.

### Process Insights

1. **Manual configuration sometimes better**: For XRDP environments, manual config files can be more reliable than abstracted home-manager modules.

2. **Test over RDP early**: Many keyboard and window management issues only manifest when testing over RDP, not in local X sessions.

3. **Iterative refinement crucial**: Multiple rounds of testing and debugging revealed optimal configurations (e.g., rofi centered layout, Alt keybindings).

4. **Documentation of decisions important**: Recording why specific approaches were chosen (Firefox PWA over Chromium) prevents regression to inferior solutions.
