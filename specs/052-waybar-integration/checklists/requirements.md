# Specification Quality Checklist: Waybar Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **PASSED**: All checklist items complete

**Spec Quality Summary**:
- 4 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 12 functional requirements (all testable)
- 10 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 5 edge cases identified
- Clear migration strategy with rollback procedure
- No clarification markers needed (all assumptions documented)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Spec maintains focus on user experience and measurable outcomes
- Event-driven architecture preservation is correctly identified as P1 priority
- Migration strategy provides safe rollback path
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific Waybar APIs, GTK functions, or CSS properties)
- All timing requirements are user-facing (hover 50ms, click 100ms) rather than technical metrics
