# Specification Quality Checklist: i3 Project Management System Validation & Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items passed successfully.

**Key Strengths**:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Specification covers all aspects requested - CRUD operations, window associations, monitor management, application launching, event subscriptions, PWA/terminal isolation, automation, and testing
2. **Event-Based Architecture**: Correctly references i3's IPC event system with specific message types (GET_TREE, GET_MARKS, GET_OUTPUTS, SUBSCRIBE) without prescribing implementation
3. **Testability**: Each user story includes independent test scenarios that can verify functionality in isolation
4. **Performance Targets**: Success criteria include specific, measurable performance targets (200ms switching, 100ms marking, 50MB memory)
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Comprehensive edge case analysis including daemon crashes, manual mark removal, monitor disconnection, circular dependencies

**Validation Against i3 IPC Documentation**:
- ✓ Uses i3's native event subscription (window, workspace, tick, output, shutdown) per docs/i3-ipc.txt section 5
- ✓ References GET_TREE for window hierarchy (section 4.5)
- ✓ References GET_MARKS for window marks (section 4.6)
- ✓ References GET_OUTPUTS for monitor configuration (section 4.4)
- ✓ Uses tick events for project switching (section 4.11, 5.10)
- ✓ Window marks persist in i3's layout state per documentation

**Relationship to Existing Implementation**:
- Specification validates and documents the current event-driven system implemented in Feature 015
- Extends current system with new capabilities: project closing, automated launching, workspace persistence
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing CLI commands and keybindings
- Leverages existing Python testing infrastructure (i3-project-monitor, i3-project-test)

**Ready for Next Phase**: This specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.
