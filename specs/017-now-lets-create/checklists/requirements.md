# Specification Quality Checklist: i3 Project System Monitor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Pass**: All checklist items pass validation.

The specification is complete and ready for planning (`/speckit.plan`) or clarification (`/speckit.clarify`) if needed.

### Strengths
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P4) with independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects
- Technology-agnostic success criteria (no mention of specific tools/frameworks)
- Well-defined edge cases
- Good assumptions documentation
- Excellent open source considerations section

### Minor Notes
- Open Source Considerations section mentions specific libraries (rich, textual, htop, etc.) but this is appropriate as they're suggestions for evaluation, not mandatory implementation details
- Assumptions correctly note that this is for initial terminal-based implementation, leaving door open for future GUI

The spec successfully balances minimal implementation focus (per user request) with comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
