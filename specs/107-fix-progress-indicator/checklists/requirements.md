# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Progress Indicator Focus State and Event Efficiency

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification includes analysis of current implementation to provide context
- Three user stories prioritized: focus state display (P1), event-driven updates (P2), spinner optimization (P3)
- Backward compatibility with file-based approach explicitly noted as fallback
- Success criteria include specific latency targets (100ms, 50ms) and CPU usage limits (2%)
- Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
