# Specification Quality Checklist: Project-Scoped Application Workspace Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (Updated 2025-10-19)

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification has been updated with clarified application details and multi-monitor support. Ready for the next phase.

### Details

**Content Quality**: All sections focus on what users need and why, without specifying how to implement. No technology stack, APIs, or code structure mentioned.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 35 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Edge cases identified with clear expected behaviors.

**Feature Readiness**: Six prioritized user stories cover the complete feature workflow including multi-monitor support. Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios. Success criteria align with user stories and provide measurable outcomes.

## Notes

- Specification successfully addresses the user's request for project-scoped workspace management with dynamic window reassignment
- Clear distinction between project-scoped (VS Code, Ghostty, lazygit, yazi) and global applications established
- Workspace range logic eliminated in favor of fixed workspaces (1-9) with dynamic content
- Multi-monitor support added with adaptive workspace distribution (1-3 monitors)
- Project-scoped applications clarified: Ghostty uses sesh for project sessions, VS Code opens project directory without --user-data-dir, lazygit connects to repository, yazi starts in project directory
- All requirements can be verified without knowing implementation details (i3 IPC, bash scripts, etc.)
