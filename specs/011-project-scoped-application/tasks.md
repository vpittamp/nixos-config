- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **NixOS configuration structure**: `/etc/nixos/`
- **Scripts**: `/etc/nixos/scripts/`
- **Home modules**: `/etc/nixos/home-modules/`
- **Documentation**: `/etc/nixos/docs/`

- [X] T027 [US3] Update projects.json applications array with projectScoped=false for Firefox, YouTube PWA, K9s (Already working: global apps don't have PROJECT tags)
- [X] T028 [US3] Test global application visibility during project switches (Firefox, YouTube PWA should remain on workspaces)
- [X] T029 [US3] Verify global applications can be launched while project is active

**Independent Test**: Activate project, hide some windows, clear project, verify all windows reappear

### Implementation for User Story 6

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Core project switching - **MVP priority**
  - User Story 2 (P1): Project-aware launchers - **MVP priority**
  - User Story 3 (P2): Global applications - Can implement in parallel with US4/US5
  - User Story 4 (P2): Polybar integration - Can implement in parallel with US3/US5
  - User Story 5 (P2): Multi-monitor support - Can implement in parallel with US3/US4
  - User Story 6 (P3): Clear project - Depends on US1 being complete
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Core switching logic
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Launcher scripts independent of US1 but work together
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (relies on project-switch-hook.sh skip logic)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on Setup (reads current-project state file)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational (uses monitor detection scripts)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (extends project-switch-hook.sh with show-all logic)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T001, T002, T003 can run in parallel (different files)

**Foundational Phase**:
- T007 (detect-monitors.sh) and T008 (assign-workspace-monitor.sh) can run in parallel
- T004-T006 must be sequential (same file: project-switch-hook.sh)

**User Story 2 (Launchers)**:
- T018, T019, T020, T021 can run in parallel (different launcher scripts)

**User Story 5 (Multi-monitor)**:
- T037-T039 can run in parallel (different conditional blocks in same script) with care
- T042-T044 can run in parallel (independent test scenarios)

**Polish Phase**:
- T051, T052, T053, T054, T058, T059 can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Launchers)

```bash
# Launch all launcher script creation together:
Task: "Create scripts/launch-code.sh"
Task: "Create scripts/launch-ghostty.sh"
Task: "Create scripts/launch-lazygit.sh"
Task: "Create scripts/launch-yazi.sh"
```

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Test on Hetzner (reference platform) first, then WSL2 and M1
- Run `nixos-rebuild dry-build --flake .#hetzner` before each apply
- Commit after each checkpoint or logical group
- Window title format: `[PROJECT:project-id] <original-title>`
- Scratchpad is primary hiding mechanism (not workspace 90+)
- Monitor priority: 1 (primary) > 2 (secondary) > 3 (tertiary)
