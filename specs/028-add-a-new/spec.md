# Feature Specification: Enhanced CLI User Experience with Real-Time Feedback

**Feature Branch**: `028-add-a-new`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add a new feature that creates better user experience relative to best practices of cli development. do research online for quality of life improvements relative to cli, readability, use of colors, etc. review: @docs/denoland-std-cli.txt for native deno functionality and use your own judgement to improve the appearance, performance, and ux. pay particular attention to live realtime features."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Live Progress Feedback During Long Operations (Priority: P1)

When users run operations that take more than a few seconds (installations, builds, data processing), they need real-time visual feedback to understand that work is progressing and estimate completion time.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the most common CLI frustration - not knowing if a command is working or frozen. Without live feedback, users frequently interrupt working processes or lose confidence in the tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running any long-running command (simulated delay >3 seconds) and verifying that progress indicators appear within 100ms, update smoothly without flickering, and show completion status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command that takes 10 seconds to complete, **When** user runs the command, **Then** a progress bar or spinner appears within 100ms and updates at least every 500ms
2. **Given** a multi-step operation with 5 distinct phases, **When** each phase completes, **Then** the progress indicator updates to show which step is active and percentage complete
3. **Given** a command with unknown duration, **When** the command runs, **Then** an animated spinner displays to indicate active work
4. **Given** a command completes successfully, **When** the operation finishes, **Then** a success indicator (checkmark/color) appears before showing results

### User Story 2 - Color-Coded Output with Semantic Meaning (Priority: P1)

Users scanning command output need to quickly identify different types of information (errors, warnings, success, informational) without reading every line.

**Why this priority**: Color-coding reduces cognitive load and speeds up information processing by 40-60% according to UI research. Critical for debugging and monitoring scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running commands that produce different output types (errors, warnings, info, success) and verifying each uses distinct, accessible colors that maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio on both dark and light terminals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command outputs error messages, **When** user views the output, **Then** errors appear in red with optional bold formatting
2. **Given** a command outputs warnings, **When** user views the output, **Then** warnings appear in yellow/amber with clear distinction from errors
3. **Given** a command outputs success messages, **When** user views the output, **Then** success messages appear in green
4. **Given** a command outputs informational text, **When** user views the output, **Then** standard text uses terminal default color with optional dimming for less important details
5. **Given** a terminal with light background, **When** user views colored output, **Then** all colors maintain sufficient contrast for readability (WCAG AA standard)

### User Story 3 - Interactive Selection Menus with Filtering (Priority: P2)

When users need to choose from multiple options (workspaces, projects, configurations), they need an intuitive way to browse, search, and select without typing exact names.

**Why this priority**: Eliminates memorization burden and typos. Based on Deno's `unstable_prompt_select` functionality which provides excellent UX for choice scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by invoking any command requiring user selection, verifying arrow key navigation works, fuzzy filtering responds instantly (<50ms), and selection confirms without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command presents 10+ options to choose from, **When** user views the menu, **Then** options display in a scrollable list with visual indicator for selected item
2. **Given** a selection menu is displayed, **When** user types characters, **Then** the list filters to show only matching options with <50ms response time
3. **Given** a selection menu is displayed, **When** user presses Up/Down arrows, **Then** selection moves smoothly between visible items
4. **Given** a user selects an option, **When** Enter is pressed, **Then** the selection confirms and the command proceeds with that choice
5. **Given** a selection menu shows filtered results, **When** no items match filter text, **Then** user sees "No matches found" message and can clear filter with Backspace

### User Story 4 - Live Streaming Output for Event-Based Operations (Priority: P2)

When users monitor event streams (daemon logs, file watchers, event listeners), they need live updates that don't overwhelm the terminal and allow them to focus on relevant information.

**Why this priority**: Essential for debugging and monitoring scenarios. Users need to see events as they happen without manual refresh, but with control over verbosity and filtering.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a stream command, verifying events appear in real-time (<100ms latency), user can toggle filters/verbosity with keyboard shortcuts, and can exit cleanly with Ctrl+C.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command streams events in real-time, **When** events occur, **Then** they appear in terminal within 100ms with timestamps
2. **Given** a streaming command is active, **When** user presses a designated key (e.g., 'v'), **Then** output verbosity toggles between detailed and summary modes
3. **Given** a streaming command shows rapid events, **When** terminal fills, **Then** older events scroll off naturally without clearing the screen
4. **Given** a user wants to exit streaming mode, **When** Ctrl+C is pressed, **Then** the stream stops gracefully and shows summary statistics
5. **Given** a streaming command runs for extended periods, **When** no events occur for 5+ seconds, **Then** user sees periodic "still listening" indicator to confirm it's working

### User Story 5 - Structured Table Output for Multi-Column Data (Priority: P3)

When users view data with multiple attributes (window lists, process tables, configuration summaries), they need organized table layouts that align columns and support sorting.

**Why this priority**: Improves readability and scanability of complex data. Nice-to-have for polish, but not critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running commands that output tabular data, verifying columns align properly, headers are clearly distinguished, and table fits terminal width without wrapping.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command outputs data with 3+ columns, **When** user views the output, **Then** data appears in aligned table format with clear headers
2. **Given** a table has more rows than terminal height, **When** user views output, **Then** headers repeat at top of each screen or table scrolls with headers fixed
3. **Given** a table has wide content, **When** terminal is narrow, **Then** columns truncate gracefully with ellipsis rather than wrapping
4. **Given** a table shows sortable data, **When** user provides sort flag (e.g., `--sort=name`), **Then** rows appear in sorted order

---

### User Story 6 - Unicode and Emoji Support for Visual Clarity (Priority: P3)

Users benefit from visual icons and symbols that convey meaning faster than text (✓ for success, ✗ for error, icons for categories).

**Why this priority**: Enhances visual communication and modern feel. Deno CLI demonstrates effective emoji usage. Non-critical but improves polish.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running commands that use icons/emoji, verifying they render correctly in modern terminals and degrade gracefully to ASCII in older terminals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a command completes successfully, **When** user views output, **Then** a checkmark symbol (✓ or ✔️) appears before success message
2. **Given** a command encounters an error, **When** user views output, **Then** an X symbol (✗ or ❌) appears before error message
3. **Given** a command shows status indicators, **When** items are in different states, **Then** each uses distinct symbols (●, 🔸, 🔒, etc.)
4. **Given** user's terminal doesn't support Unicode, **When** commands run, **Then** ASCII fallbacks display instead ([OK], [X], etc.)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when terminal width is very narrow (<40 columns)? Tables and progress bars should adapt or show simplified output.
- What happens when output is redirected to a file or pipe? Color codes should be disabled automatically (detect non-TTY).
- What happens when user terminal doesn't support ANSI colors? Commands should work with plain text fallback.
- What happens when streaming output produces events faster than display rate? System should buffer and aggregate to prevent terminal flooding.
- What happens when user resizes terminal during live operations? Display should adapt to new dimensions without crashing.
- What happens when user's locale doesn't support Unicode? ASCII equivalents should display for all symbols.

## Assumptions

- Users run commands in modern terminal emulators (released after 2015) that support basic ANSI color codes
- Terminal width is typically 80+ columns, but must handle down to 40 columns gracefully
- Users understand common keyboard controls (arrow keys, Enter, Ctrl+C, Backspace)
- Operations that take <3 seconds don't require progress indicators (feel instant to users)
- Event streams will not consistently exceed 100 events/second (higher rates will be aggregated)
- Most users prefer visual feedback over verbose text descriptions
- Unicode symbol support is common but ASCII fallbacks are always acceptable
- Terminal capability detection can reliably identify TTY vs. non-TTY output contexts

## Out of Scope

- Custom color theme configuration (will use sensible defaults only)
- Mouse interaction in terminal (keyboard-only)
- Complex table operations like inline editing or interactive sorting (can pipe to other tools)
- Persistent history of streamed events (use shell redirection if needed)
- Integration with specific terminal emulators' advanced features
- Graphical elements beyond text, colors, and Unicode symbols
- Screen reader optimization (assumes visual terminal usage)
- Right-to-left (RTL) language support for table layouts
