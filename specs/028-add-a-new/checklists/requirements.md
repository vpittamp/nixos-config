# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced CLI User Experience with Real-Time Feedback

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Content Quality Assessment

- ✅ Specification focuses entirely on what users need and why
- ✅ No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or languages
- ✅ Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- ✅ All requirements are clear and unambiguous
- ✅ Each functional requirement can be independently verified through testing
- ✅ Success criteria include both quantitative metrics (latency, percentages) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation terms (no mentions of "React", "database", "API", etc.)
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format consistently
- ✅ Edge cases cover terminal capabilities, redirection, Unicode support, performance limits
- ✅ Scope clearly defines what is included and excluded (Out of Scope section)
- ✅ Assumptions document reasonable defaults and constraints

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- ✅ 18 functional requirements with specific, testable criteria
- ✅ 6 prioritized user stories covering complete user journeys from P1 (critical) to P3 (nice-to-have)
- ✅ 12 measurable success criteria with specific targets (response times, user satisfaction percentages, business metrics)
- ✅ Specification remains at business/user level throughout - no technical implementation leakage

## Notes

The specification is production-ready and can proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phases without modifications. All quality criteria have been met:

1. **Completeness**: All required sections are thorough and well-structured
2. **Clarity**: No ambiguous requirements or undefined terms
3. **Measurability**: Success criteria provide clear, verifiable targets
4. **User Focus**: Entire spec written from user/business perspective
5. **Independence**: Each user story can be developed and tested standalone
6. **Prioritization**: Clear P1/P2/P3 priorities enable phased implementation

Key strengths:
- Excellent use of Deno CLI patterns as reference (progress bars, selection menus, spinners)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (terminal capabilities, Unicode fallbacks, graceful degradation)
- Strong focus on real-time feedback and responsiveness (specific latency targets)
- Well-documented assumptions about target environments
- Clear out-of-scope boundaries prevent feature creep
