# Specification Quality Checklist: M1 Configuration Alignment with Hetzner-Sway

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality ✅
- Specification focuses on configuration parity and user workflow consistency
- Written from perspective of system administrator/developer managing multiple platforms
- Avoids NixOS implementation details (stays technology-agnostic where possible)
- All mandatory sections completed with comprehensive content

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- No clarification markers - all requirements are well-defined
- 15 functional requirements, all testable (e.g., FR-001: "MUST import exact same base modules")
- 10 success criteria, all measurable (e.g., SC-001: "95% or higher configuration parity")
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes: workflow portability, rebuild success, maintenance effort
- 5 user stories with clear acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- 5 edge cases identified covering architecture differences, package availability, and compatibility
- Scope clearly bounded: aligning M1 to hetzner-sway (not the reverse)
- 10 documented architectural differences with rationale
- 10 assumptions clearly stated

### Feature Readiness ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover all major flows: service configuration, home manager setup, hardware differentiation, daemon alignment, documentation
- Measurable outcomes align with user value: 95%+ parity, zero workflow differences, 40% maintenance reduction
- Specification stays at "what" level without diving into "how" (implementation details are appropriate for planning phase)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

This specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. All checklist items pass validation. The spec clearly defines:

1. **User Value**: Cross-platform consistency enables seamless workflow transfer between M1 and Hetzner platforms
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Specific parity percentages, latency targets, and maintenance metrics
3. **Bounded Scope**: Aligning M1 to hetzner-sway while respecting architectural constraints
4. **Clear Exceptions**: 10 documented architectural differences prevent scope creep

No specification updates needed before proceeding to planning.
