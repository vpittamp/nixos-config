# Tasks: i3 Project Workspace Management System

**Feature Branch**: `010-i3-project-workspace`
**Input**: Design documents from `/etc/nixos/specs/010-i3-project-workspace/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úì, spec.md ‚úì, research.md ‚úì, data-model.md ‚úì, contracts/ ‚úì

**Tests**: NOT included (not requested in feature specification)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- NixOS module structure:
  - System module: `modules/desktop/i3-project-workspace.nix`
  - Home-manager module: `home-modules/desktop/i3-projects.nix`
  - Documentation: `docs/I3_PROJECT_WORKSPACE.md`
  - Scripts embedded in modules via `pkgs.writeShellScriptBin`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic NixOS module structure

- [X] T001 [P] Create system module structure at `modules/desktop/i3-project-workspace.nix` with basic options and module scaffold

**Checkpoint**: Module structure ready for implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Define Nix types for Project entity in `home-modules/desktop/i3-projects.nix` (displayName, workspaces, primaryWorkspace, workingDirectory, enabled, autostart)
- [ ] T005 Define Nix types for WorkspaceConfig entity in `home-modules/desktop/i3-projects.nix` (number, output, outputs, applications, layout, layoutMode)
- [ ] T006 Define Nix types for ApplicationConfig entity in `home-modules/desktop/i3-projects.nix` (package, command, wmClass, wmInstance, workingDirectory, args, instanceBehavior, launchDelay, floating, position, size)
- [ ] T007 Implement project configuration validation in `home-modules/desktop/i3-projects.nix` (assertions for unique names, valid workspace references, existing packages)
- [ ] T008 Implement JSON configuration generation in `home-modules/desktop/i3-projects.nix` to create `~/.config/i3-projects/projects.json` from Nix definitions

- [ ] T011 [P] Implement conditional module activation based on i3wm presence in both system and home-manager modules

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quick Project Environment Switch (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable instant switching between complete project environments with all applications launching in correct positions

- [ ] T021 [US1] Add error handling and user feedback to all commands: project not found, i3 communication errors, application launch failures
- [ ] T022 [US1] Implement --dry-run flag for `activate` command: show what would be done without executing
- [ ] T023 [US1] Implement --verbose flag for detailed activation progress across all commands

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can define projects in Nix, activate them, list them, close them, and switch between them

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Declarative Project Configuration via NixOS (Priority: P1)

- [ ] T031 [US2] Implement configuration update detection: warn users when config changed but not rebuilt

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - users can fully manage projects via declarative Nix configuration

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Multi-Monitor Workspace Management (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable project environments spanning multiple displays with graceful single-monitor fallback

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Ad-Hoc Project Creation from Running State (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Capture current workspace layouts and save them as declarative project configurations

- [ ] T049 [US4] Add --no-layouts flag support: skip layout file generation, only capture application definitions
- [ ] T050 [US4] Implement capture summary output: show what was captured, file paths, next steps for user integration
- [ ] T051 [US4] Add warnings for problematic windows: no WM_CLASS, command detection failed, empty workspaces included

**Checkpoint**: Layout capture fully functional - users can capture workspace arrangements and convert them to declarative configurations

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Shorthand Project Activation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable power users to quickly compose workspace configurations via compact command-line syntax

**Independent Test**: Execute shorthand command like "i3-project compose vsc:1 ff:2 term:3", verify applications launch on specified workspaces

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T058 [US5] Implement common alias defaults in module: provide built-in aliases for common apps (ff, vsc, term, etc.)
- [ ] T059 [US5] Add project overlay support in `i3-project activate`: --add flag to launch additional apps beyond project definition

**Checkpoint**: Shorthand syntax working - power users can compose temporary workspaces without editing config files

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Git Repository Integration (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Automatically associate project environments with repository directories for context-aware application launching

**Independent Test**: Define project linked to git repo path, activate project, verify terminals open in repo root and editors open repo workspace

### Implementation for User Story 6

- [ ] T060 [P] [US6] Add repository path detection in project activation: check if workingDirectory is a git repository

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Core functionality - no dependencies on other stories ‚úì MVP
  - User Story 2 (P1): Builds on US1 configuration - can run in parallel with US1
  - User Story 3 (P2): Independent - only needs US1 for basic activation
  - User Story 4 (P2): Independent - captures existing layouts, generates configs for US1/US2
  - User Story 5 (P3): Depends on US2 (aliases concept) - enhances US1/US2
  - User Story 6 (P3): Independent - adds repository context to US1/US2 projects
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup (Phase 1)**:
- All three module structure tasks (T001, T002, T003) can run in parallel

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- T004-T006 (type definitions) can run in parallel
- T010-T011 (packages and conditional activation) can run in parallel

**Across User Stories** (once Phase 2 complete):
- US1 + US2 + US4 can all start in parallel
- US3 can start once US1 reaches T014
- US5 can start once US2 reaches T053
- US6 can start once US1 reaches T014

**Within Phase 9 (Polish)**:
- T067, T068, T069, T070, T071 (documentation and integrations) all parallel
- T073-T080 can run in any order

---

## Parallel Example: Maximum Parallelism After Foundation

```bash
# After Phase 2 completes, launch multiple user stories in parallel:

# Team Member A: User Story 1 (Core functionality)
Task: T012 - T023 (Project activation, list, status, switch, close)

# Team Member B: User Story 2 (Declarative config)
Task: T024 - T031 (Configuration examples, reload, parameterization)

# Team Member C: User Story 4 (Layout capture)
Task: T038 - T051 (Workspace scanning, layout capture, config generation)

# All three can proceed independently until they need integration points
```

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **No tests included**: Feature spec did not request TDD approach
- **NixOS-specific**: All code embedded in modules via pkgs.writeShellScriptBin patterns
- **Each user story independently completable**: Can stop after any story for incremental delivery
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., after each command implementation)
- **Checkpoints**: Stop at story completion to validate independently before moving forward
- **Avoid**: Cross-story dependencies that break independence (except where noted as enhancements)
