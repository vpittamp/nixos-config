# Specification Quality Checklist: i3 Project Workspace Management System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Status

**Overall Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - READY FOR PLANNING

All design decisions have been resolved:

1. **Default Project Activation Behavior**: Option A - Keep all projects running, focus switches to new project workspace
2. **Application Instance Handling**: Option B - Detect single-instance applications and configure them as "shared" across projects by default
3. **Layout Capture Scope**: Option B - Capture all non-empty workspaces by default

## Notes

- All functional requirements are well-defined and testable
- Success criteria are appropriately measurable and technology-agnostic
- User stories are properly prioritized and independently testable
- Edge cases comprehensively cover likely scenarios
- Assumptions and out-of-scope items clearly defined
- Design decisions documented with rationale and implementation notes
- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
