# Specification Quality Checklist: Linux System Log Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Checklist Items Pass

The specification successfully meets all quality criteria:

1. **Content Quality**:
   - Spec focuses on WHAT users need (view systemd events, monitor processes, correlate events) without HOW to implement
   - Requirements are stated in terms of user capabilities and system behaviors, not technical implementation
   - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., "developers debugging application startup issues")

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 27 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria from user scenarios
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (e.g., "within 1 second", "at least 95%", "below 5% CPU")
   - All success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not system internals)
   - Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear expected outcomes
   - Edge cases cover boundary conditions (permissions, high frequency, missing data)
   - Scope section clearly defines what's in/out of scope
   - Dependencies and assumptions are documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - Three prioritized user stories cover primary flows: P1 (systemd integration), P2 (process monitoring), P3 (correlation)
   - Success criteria align with measurable user outcomes from scenarios
   - No implementation leakage detected (no mention of specific APIs, database schemas, code architecture)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All three user stories can be implemented independently as MVPs
- Priority ordering (P1 → P2 → P3) provides clear implementation sequence
- Consider `/speckit.clarify` only if user requests changes to feature scope or requirements
