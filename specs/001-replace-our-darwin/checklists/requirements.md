## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses on WHAT (system-level package management, home-manager integration, 1Password setup) and WHY (consistency with NixOS systems, declarative configuration) without specifying HOW (specific file paths, implementation approaches are mentioned only in FR identifiers, not in user stories).

✅ **Pass** - The specification is written from a user perspective with clear value propositions: "so that my development environment is consistent", "so that my user-level dotfiles work seamlessly", "so that I can access secrets consistently".

✅ **Pass** - All user stories use plain language and avoid technical jargon where possible. Technical terms (nix-darwin, home-manager) are necessary domain vocabulary but are explained through context.

✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections are complete: User Scenarios & Testing (5 prioritized stories), Requirements (15 functional requirements), Success Criteria (10 measurable outcomes), plus Assumptions and Out of Scope.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are specific and deterministic.

✅ **Pass** - All 15 functional requirements are testable:
- FR-001 through FR-003: Testable by verifying configuration files and package availability
- FR-004 through FR-006: Testable by running 1Password and Nix commands
- FR-007 through FR-011: Testable by checking imports, fonts, garbage collection, SSH config
- FR-012 through FR-015: Testable by inspecting configuration patterns and macOS integrations

✅ **Pass** - All success criteria include specific metrics:
- Time-based: "within 20%" (SC-007)
- Action-based: "can rebuild", "are available", "work identically" (SC-001 through SC-004)
- Compatibility-based: "across macOS version upgrades", "between Intel and Apple Silicon" (SC-006, SC-009)
- Persistence-based: "persist across rebuilds" (SC-010)

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria avoid implementation details:
- Uses "rebuild the Darwin system" instead of "run nix-darwin build command"
- Uses "development tools are available" instead of "packages are installed in /nix/store"
- Uses "configurations work identically" instead of "dotfiles are symlinked correctly"

✅ **Pass** - All 5 user stories have 2-3 acceptance scenarios each, covering:
- Fresh installation (US1.1, US2.1)
- Configuration changes (US1.2)
- Runtime behavior (US1.3, US2.2, US2.3, US3.1, US3.2, US3.3, US4.1, US4.2, US4.3, US5.1, US5.2, US5.3)

✅ **Pass** - 5 edge cases identified covering:
- Integration conflicts (Homebrew)
- Platform differences (launchd vs systemd)
- Package availability (NixOS vs macOS)
- Architecture differences (Apple Silicon vs Intel)
- System upgrades (macOS version changes)

✅ **Pass** - Scope clearly bounded:
- **In Scope**: nix-darwin configuration, home-manager integration, system packages, 1Password, development tools, macOS preferences
- **Out of Scope**: Docker Desktop installation, Homebrew migration, App Store apps, Xcode management, multi-user configurations
- 7 explicit out-of-scope items listed

✅ **Pass** - 7 assumptions documented:
- Nix already installed
- Docker Desktop separate
- 1Password account exists
- macOS 12.0+
- Admin privileges
- Existing darwin-home.nix works
- Standard macOS directory structure

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Each functional requirement maps to user stories:
- FR-001, FR-002 support US1 (System-Level Package Management)
- FR-007, FR-013 support US2 (Home-Manager Integration)
- FR-004, FR-010 support US3 (1Password Integration)
- FR-003, FR-011 support US4 (Development Services)
- FR-015 supports US5 (macOS System Preferences)

✅ **Pass** - The 5 user stories provide comprehensive coverage:
- P1 stories (US1, US2) cover foundation: system packages and user configs
- P2 stories (US3, US4) cover essential development workflow: secrets and services
- P3 story (US5) covers enhancement: system preferences

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria align with user story priorities:
- SC-001, SC-002 validate US1 (system rebuild and packages)
- SC-003, SC-008 validate US2 (user configs work)
- SC-004 validates US3 (1Password SSH)
- SC-005 validates US4 (Docker integration)
- SC-010 validates US5 (preferences persist)
- SC-006, SC-007, SC-009 validate cross-cutting concerns (upgrades, performance, cross-platform)

✅ **Pass** - No implementation leakage detected. The specification uses declarative language ("MUST configure", "MUST provide", "MUST enable") without prescribing specific implementation approaches. File names in FR text are identifiers, not implementation mandates.

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is:
- Complete with all mandatory sections
- Clear and unambiguous
- Testable with measurable success criteria
- Technology-agnostic (focused on outcomes, not implementation)
- Well-scoped with explicit boundaries
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`

## Notes

No issues found. The specification successfully translates a technical migration task (replacing home-manager with nix-darwin) into user-centric value propositions while maintaining necessary technical accuracy. The 5 prioritized user stories provide a clear incremental delivery path: foundation (P1), essential workflow (P2), enhancements (P3).
