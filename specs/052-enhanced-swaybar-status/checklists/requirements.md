# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Swaybar Status

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Validation Notes**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user needs and system behaviors without mentioning specific technologies, programming languages, or implementation approaches. Written in clear, non-technical language.

2. **Requirements**: All 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Each requirement can be independently verified through testing.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 9 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-009) are measurable, technology-agnostic, and user-focused. They include specific metrics (time, percentages, response times) without referencing implementation details.

4. **User Scenarios**: Four prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3, P1) with clear acceptance scenarios covering:
   - Visual system status monitoring (P1)
   - Interactive status controls (P2)
   - Enhanced visual feedback (P3)
   - Native Sway integration preservation (P1)

5. **Edge Cases**: Seven edge cases identified covering missing hardware, multiple interfaces, system states, and error conditions.

6. **Scope**: Clear boundaries defined with Assumptions (10 items), Constraints (5 items), and Non-Goals (6 items) sections.

7. **No Clarifications Needed**: Specification is complete with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

## Recommendation

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - This specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command.

The specification successfully:
- Defines clear user value (improved system monitoring and control)
- Establishes measurable success criteria
- Maintains technology-agnostic language
- Provides comprehensive edge case coverage
- Documents assumptions and constraints
- Preserves backwards compatibility requirements

**Next Steps**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.
