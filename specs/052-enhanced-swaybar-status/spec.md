# Feature Specification: Enhanced Swaybar Status

**Feature Branch**: `052-enhanced-swaybar-status`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a feature that uses swaybar to enhance the current status bars to make it look much better, enhance functionality, and adds volume, battery, bluetooth, wifi statuses. make sure we keep the native sway functionality that is exposed for the status bar. think of what we can do to enhance the user experience, including hover effect, click funtionality, icons"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Visual System Status Monitoring (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see my system's current status (volume, battery, network, bluetooth) at a glance in the status bar with clear visual indicators and icons, so that I can quickly understand my system's state without opening additional applications.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - provides essential system information that users need to monitor continuously. Without this, users cannot see basic system metrics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the enhanced status bar and verifying that all system status indicators (volume, battery, WiFi, Bluetooth) are visible with appropriate icons and current values, delivering immediate visibility of system state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I look at the status bar, **Then** I see volume level with an icon and percentage
2. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I look at the status bar, **Then** I see battery level with an icon and percentage (when battery present)
3. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I look at the status bar, **Then** I see WiFi status with an icon and connection state
4. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I look at the status bar, **Then** I see Bluetooth status with an icon and connection state
5. **Given** system status changes (e.g., battery drains, volume adjusts), **When** the change occurs, **Then** the status bar updates within 2 seconds

### User Story 2 - Interactive Status Controls (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to interact with status bar elements through clicks to quickly adjust settings or view more details, so that I can control my system without opening full settings applications.

**Why this priority**: Significantly improves user experience by reducing clicks and navigation time. Users can adjust common settings directly from the status bar.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking on each status element (volume, network, bluetooth) and verifying that appropriate controls or menus appear, delivering quick access to system controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I click on the volume indicator, **Then** a volume control appears allowing me to adjust volume
2. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I click on the WiFi indicator, **Then** a network menu appears showing available networks
3. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I click on the Bluetooth indicator, **Then** a bluetooth menu appears showing paired devices
4. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I click on the battery indicator, **Then** detailed power information is displayed

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Visual Feedback (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to see visual feedback when I hover over status bar elements, so that I understand which elements are interactive and can access additional context.

**Why this priority**: Improves discoverability and user experience, but not critical for basic functionality. Users can still use the status bar effectively without hover effects.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by hovering over each status element and verifying that visual feedback (tooltip, highlight, or color change) appears, delivering improved discoverability of interactive elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I hover over a status element, **Then** the element highlights or changes appearance to indicate it's interactive
2. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I hover over a status element, **Then** a tooltip appears showing detailed information (e.g., exact battery time remaining, connected network name, paired device details)
3. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I move my cursor away from an element, **Then** the hover effect disappears within 200 milliseconds

### User Story 4 - Native Sway Integration Preservation (Priority: P1)

As a user and system administrator, I want to retain all native Sway status bar functionality (workspace indicators, binding mode, system tray support), so that existing workflows and configurations continue to work seamlessly.

**Why this priority**: Critical for backwards compatibility. Breaking existing Sway functionality would disrupt current workflows and potentially make the system unusable for users relying on native features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all native Sway status bar features (workspaces, binding modes, window titles, system tray) continue to function as expected alongside enhanced status elements, delivering seamless integration without feature loss.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I switch workspaces, **Then** workspace indicators update correctly in the status bar
2. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I enter a Sway binding mode, **Then** the binding mode indicator displays correctly
3. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** applications add system tray icons, **Then** the system tray displays correctly in the status bar
4. **Given** the enhanced status bar is running, **When** I use Sway's native status bar configuration options, **Then** those options are respected and applied

### Edge Cases

- What happens when battery hardware is not present (desktop systems)? Status bar should gracefully hide battery indicator or show "AC Power" state
- How does system handle multiple network interfaces (WiFi + Ethernet)? Should display primary active connection or show multiple indicators
- What happens when Bluetooth hardware is disabled or not present? Indicator should show disabled state or be hidden
- How does status bar respond when audio system is unavailable or muted? Should show muted icon and handle no audio gracefully
- What happens when user clicks on a status element while another menu is already open? Should close previous menu and open new one, or allow multiple open menus
- How does system handle very long device/network names in tooltips or menus? Should truncate or wrap text appropriately
- What happens during system suspend/resume? Status bar should reconnect to system services and update all indicators

10. **User Permissions**: Assumes user has necessary permissions to query system status (battery, network, bluetooth, audio) without root access

## Constraints

1. **Compatibility**: Must not break existing Sway configurations or status bar setups
2. **Resource Usage**: Status bar monitoring processes should use minimal CPU (<2% average) and memory (<50MB)
3. **Visual Space**: Status indicators must fit within standard status bar height (typically 20-30 pixels) without causing overflow
4. **Responsiveness**: All user interactions (clicks, hovers) must respond within 100 milliseconds
5. **Dependencies**: Should minimize external dependencies to reduce installation complexity and system requirements

## Non-Goals

1. **Advanced Configuration UI**: This feature does not include a graphical configuration tool for customizing status bar appearance or behavior
2. **Historical Monitoring**: This feature does not provide historical graphs or logs of system metrics (battery usage over time, network bandwidth history)
3. **System Notifications**: This feature does not replace or integrate with system notification daemon (separate concern)
4. **Multi-Monitor Support**: Initial version assumes single status bar instance; multi-monitor scenarios are out of scope
5. **Mobile/Touch Optimization**: This feature is designed for desktop environments with mouse/keyboard input, not touch interfaces
6. **Third-Party Application Status**: Only system-level status (volume, battery, network, bluetooth) is included; application-specific indicators are out of scope
