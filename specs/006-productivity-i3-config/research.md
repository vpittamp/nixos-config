# Research: Productivity-Focused i3wm Configuration

## Research Date: 2025-10-16

## Executive Summary

Based on research of popular i3wm configurations and NixOS implementations, we've identified key patterns and features that make i3wm highly productive for developers, especially when integrated with tmux and focused on workspace-based workflows.

## Key Findings

### 1. Popular i3wm Configuration Patterns

#### Status Bars
- **Polybar**: Most popular modern status bar replacement
  - Highly customizable with modules
  - Better aesthetics than default i3bar
  - Large community with scripts collection
- **i3status-rust**: Async, performant alternative written in Rust
  - Native performance
  - Rich module ecosystem
  - Better for resource-constrained environments

#### Terminal Integration
- **Dropdown/Scratchpad Terminal**: Universal pattern across all reviewed configs
  - Terminal with tmux pre-loaded in scratchpad
  - Quick toggle with keybinding (commonly `Win+grave`)
  - Serves as command palette alternative
- **Default Terminal**: Alacritty or Kitty most common
  - GPU-accelerated
  - Fast startup
  - Good tmux compatibility

### 2. tmux + i3 Integration Best Practices

#### Seamless Workflows
- **tmux-tilish**: Plugin making tmux feel like i3wm
  - Consistent keybindings between tmux and i3
  - Reduces context switching
  - Ideal for remote sessions
- **i3tmux**: Manages tmux panes as i3 windows
  - Unified workflow
  - Single mental model

#### Configuration Patterns
```
i3 Workspaces (10 virtual desktops)
  â†“
Each workspace contains applications
  â†“
Terminal applications run tmux sessions
  â†“
tmux provides terminal multiplexing within i3 windows
```

**Key Insight**: i3 manages GUI layout, tmux manages terminal layout. Don't fight this - embrace it.

### 3. Workspace Management Strategies

#### Common Patterns (from reviewed configs)
1. **Role-Based Workspaces** (Most Common)
   ```
   1: Main/Terminal
   2: Code (IDE/Editors)
   3: Web (Browsers)
   4: Communication (Slack/Email)
   5: Music/Media
   6-10: Dynamic/Project-specific
   ```

2. **Project-Based Workspaces**
   - Each project gets dedicated workspace(s)
   - Use workspace naming: `1:ProjectA`, `2:ProjectB`
   - Better for context isolation

3. **Activity-Based Workspaces**
   - Design/Mockups
   - Development
   - Testing/QA
   - Documentation
   - Meetings/Collaboration

#### Productivity Features
- **Workspace Auto-Back-And-Forth**: Toggle between current and previous workspace
- **Workspace Assignments**: Auto-assign applications to workspaces
- **Workspace Persistence**: Named workspaces survive reboots
- **Workspace Renaming**: Dynamic workspace naming based on content

### 4. Scratchpad Workflows

#### What is Scratchpad?
Hidden floating workspace for quick-access applications. Press keybinding â†’ window appears centered and floating. Press again â†’ window disappears back to scratchpad.

#### Common Scratchpad Uses
1. **Dropdown Terminal** (Most Popular)
   - Terminal with tmux session
   - Quick command execution
   - System monitoring (htop, btop)

2. **Calculator** (xcalc, gnome-calculator)
   - Quick math without disrupting workflow

3. **Notes/Scratch Pad** (gVim, nvim in floating terminal)
   - Quick note taking
   - Code snippets
   - TODO lists

4. **Music Player** (ncmpcpp, cmus)
   - Control music without switching workspace

5. **Password Manager** (1Password mini, keepassxc)
   - Quick password lookup

#### Implementation Pattern
```nix
# Startup commands
for_window [instance="dropdown_terminal"] move scratchpad
exec --no-startup-id alacritty --class dropdown_terminal -e tmux

# Keybinding
bindsym $mod+grave [instance="dropdown_terminal"] scratchpad show
```

### 5. Keybinding Philosophy

#### Common Modifier Key Choices
- **Win/Super (Mod4)**: Most popular (doesn't conflict with apps)
- **Alt (Mod1)**: Alternative, but conflicts with many applications

#### Standard Keybinding Categories
1. **Navigation**: Mod+Arrows, Mod+hjkl
2. **Window Management**: Mod+Shift+[key]
3. **Workspaces**: Mod+[1-9], Mod+Shift+[1-9]
4. **Applications**: Mod+[letter] (c=code, b=browser, etc.)
5. **System**: Mod+Shift+[e/r/q] (exit, reload, quit)
6. **Modes**: Mod+r (resize), Mod+x (system menu)

#### Reviewed Configurations Use Vim-style hjkl
- h: left
- j: down
- k: up
- l: right

**Benefits**: Same muscle memory as vim/tmux/many CLI tools

### 6. Appearance & Theming

#### Color Schemes
- **Catppuccin**: Most trending (2024-2025)
- **Dracula**: Classic, widely supported
- **Nord**: Minimal, professional
- **Gruvbox**: Retro, warm colors
- **Tokyo Night**: Modern, popular with developers

#### Window Decorations
- **No Borders** on single window (smart_borders)
- **Minimal borders** when multiple windows (1-2px)
- **No title bars** (relies on status bar for window info)

#### Gaps (i3-gaps)
- **Inner gaps**: 5-10px between windows
- **Outer gaps**: 5-10px from screen edges
- **Smart gaps**: Disabled when only one window
- **Gaps modes**: Toggle gaps on/off per workspace

### 7. NixOS Home-Manager Integration

2: Code (VS Code, editors)
3: Web (Firefox, browsers)
4: Comm (Slack, email if used)
5-10: Dynamic (project-specific)
```

### 5. Configuration Management
**Recommendation**: Migrate to home-manager i3 module
- Currently using NixOS module (`modules/desktop/i3wm.nix`)
- Migrate to home-manager for per-user customization
- Allows different configs per machine
- Better integration with dotfiles

## Architecture Comparison

### Current Approach (NixOS Module)
```
/etc/nixos/modules/desktop/i3wm.nix
  â””â”€ Generates /etc/i3/config
     â””â”€ System-wide config
        â””â”€ Same for all users
```

**Pros**:
- Simple
- Works for single-user
- Easy to manage with rest of system config

**Cons**:
- Can't customize per-user
- Requires rebuild for changes
- Not portable across machines

### Recommended Approach (home-manager)
```
/etc/nixos/home-modules/desktop/i3.nix
  â””â”€ xsession.windowManager.i3
     â””â”€ config.keybindings = { ... }
     â””â”€ config.bars = [ ... ]
     â””â”€ config.startup = [ ... ]
```

**Pros**:
- Per-user customization
- Can sync across machines
- Faster iteration (no system rebuild)
- Better for dotfiles management

**Cons**:
- More complex initially
- Requires home-manager setup
- Learning curve for Nix expressions

## Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Extend Current NixOS Module (Faster)
- Build on existing `modules/desktop/i3wm.nix`
- Add features incrementally
- Good for MVP/testing
- Migrate to home-manager later

### Option B: Migrate to home-manager Now (Better Long-term)
- Create `home-modules/desktop/i3.nix`
- Full declarative config
- Better architecture
- More work upfront

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, migrate to Option B in Phase 2-3
