# Specification Quality Checklist: Event-Driven Workspace Mode Navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - performance improvements, user experience clearly stated
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - uses plain language, avoids Python/Sway internals
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - all requirements are clear
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - each FR has clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - all SC include specific metrics (ms, %, count)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - focus on user outcomes not implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 21 acceptance scenarios across 6 user stories
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 7 edge cases documented with expected behavior
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section lists 9 excluded features
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 8 assumptions, 5 dependencies, 6 risks documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 44 FRs with specific behaviors
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 user stories with P1/P2/P3 priorities
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 12 success criteria defined
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - references to "daemon", "IPC" are behavioral not implementation

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive functional requirements (44 FRs) organized by category
- Clear performance targets (10ms digit accumulation, 20ms workspace switch)
- Excellent edge case coverage with expected behaviors
- Strong prioritization (3 P1 stories, 2 P2 stories, 1 P3 story)
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic

**Notes**:
- Spec references "Python" and "daemon" in context but describes behaviors not implementation
- User stories are independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Performance improvements quantified (70ms → 30ms total latency)
- Platform support clearly defined (M1, Hetzner, 1-3 monitors)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - no clarifications needed
