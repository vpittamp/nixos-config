## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details present
- Specification describes WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Technology mentioned only in Dependencies section (appropriate context)
- All descriptions focus on user outcomes and behaviors

✅ **PASS** - Focused on user value
- Executive summary clearly states user benefits
- 6 prioritized user stories with clear value propositions
- All requirements trace back to user needs

✅ **PASS** - Non-technical accessibility
- User stories written in plain language
- Technical jargon limited to necessary domain terminology
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format accessible to all stakeholders

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections completed
- User Scenarios & Testing: Complete with 6 prioritized stories
- Requirements: 42 functional requirements organized by category
- Success Criteria: 12 measurable outcomes
- All sections fully populated with concrete details

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- Specification is complete with all questions answered
- Open Questions section provides recommendations for remaining decisions
- All requirements are concrete and actionable

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Each FR specifies exact behavior with MUST statements
- Quantifiable criteria where applicable (e.g., FR-004: "200ms for <50 windows")
- Clear acceptance tests in each user story

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable
- SC-001: "switch in under 300ms, 95% of the time" (time + percentile)
- SC-002: "30 days without restart, <50MB memory" (duration + memory bound)
- SC-005: "15 minutes using guided tools" (time-to-value)
- SC-007: "80%+ code coverage" (coverage metric)
- All 12 criteria include specific numbers or percentages

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- No mention of specific frameworks, languages, or tools
- Focused on user-observable outcomes
- Example: "Layout restoration completes without visible window flicker" (not "React components render without re-mount")

✅ **PASS** - All acceptance scenarios defined
- 6 user stories with 5 scenarios each = 30 total acceptance tests
- Each scenario follows Given/When/Then structure
- Scenarios cover happy paths and error conditions

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified
- 10 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- Covers boundary conditions, error scenarios, and unusual states
- Each edge case includes recommended handling approach

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded
- Out of Scope section lists 10 excluded capabilities
- Clear rationale for exclusions (complexity, risk, infrastructure needs)
- Prevents scope creep during implementation

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies and assumptions identified
- 10 assumptions documented in Assumptions section
- Technical dependencies listed with purpose
- Feature dependencies trace to previous work (Features 010-029)
- External dependencies identified (NixOS, Git, Desktop files, X11)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- Each FR is testable (e.g., FR-004 can be verified with latency measurements)
- Requirements map to user story acceptance scenarios
- Cross-reference: FR-001 → User Story 4, FR-007-014 → User Story 2, etc.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover primary flows
- Priority P1 stories: Reliable project switching (Story 1) and production scale (Story 4)
- Priority P2 stories: Layout persistence (Story 2) and monitoring (Story 3)
- Priority P3 stories: Security (Story 5) and onboarding (Story 6)
- Covers complete user journey from installation to daily use

✅ **PASS** - Feature meets measurable outcomes
- All 12 success criteria are verifiable
- Criteria cover performance (SC-001, SC-008), reliability (SC-002, SC-010), usability (SC-005, SC-006), and quality (SC-007)
- Each criterion has clear pass/fail threshold

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details leak
- Specification focuses on capabilities, not code structure
- Technology mentioned only in context (Dependencies, Migration)
- Example validation: "System MUST capture complete workspace layouts" (not "Python daemon serializes window tree to JSON")

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Testable and measurable
- Technology-agnostic and user-focused
- Well-scoped with clear boundaries

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.

## Notes

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive coverage**: 42 functional requirements organized into 7 logical categories
2. **Clear prioritization**: 6 user stories with P1/P2/P3 priorities enable incremental delivery
3. **Strong traceability**: Requirements, user stories, and success criteria are well-connected
4. **Realistic scope**: 80-85% production ready with clear remaining gaps identified
5. **Excellent context**: Executive summary provides full picture of system state
6. **Production-focused**: Success criteria emphasize scale, reliability, and real-world usage

### Areas of Excellence

- **Edge case coverage**: 10 edge cases with recommended handling approaches
- **Security consideration**: Dedicated user story (P3) and requirements (FR-030-034) for multi-user deployment
- **Onboarding focus**: User story 6 ensures adoption is not hindered by complexity
- **Migration path**: Clear guidance for existing users (Features 015/025/029)
- **Documentation requirements**: 8 specific documentation deliverables identified

### Minor Observations

- **No blocking issues identified**
- Specification is production-ready and can proceed to planning phase
- Open Questions section provides sensible recommendations for remaining decisions
- Out of Scope section prevents feature creep while leaving room for future enhancements
