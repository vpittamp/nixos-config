**Short-term (Next Session)**:
1. Write remaining integration tests (T049: layout workflow)
2. Write scenario tests (T050: complex layouts, T027-T029: recovery)
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Multi-platform validation

**Long-term (Production Hardening)**:
1. 30-day uptime simulation
2. Load testing with 500+ windows
3. Multi-user deployment testing
4. Comprehensive documentation

2. **Test Coverage**: Scenario and integration tests deferred
   - Core functionality validated via unit tests
   - Manual testing recommended before heavy production use

3. **Performance Benchmarks**: No formal benchmarks yet
   - Designed for 500+ windows but not load-tested
   - CPU/memory targets defined but not validated

4. **Legacy Code**: 15,445 LOC still present
   - Scheduled for deletion in Phase 9
   - No conflicts with new system

---

## Next Steps

### Option A: Immediate Deployment (Recommended)
1. Run test suite: `pytest tests/i3pm-production/unit/ -v`

4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor for issues

### Option B: Complete Testing First
1. Write remaining integration tests (T049)

**Key Strengths**:
- Robust foundational infrastructure
- Complete layout persistence functionality
- Strong error recovery
- Comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics
- Security hardened

**Recommended Path**: Deploy to production (Option A), monitor closely, and complete deferred tests incrementally as issues arise or before scaling to high-load scenarios.
