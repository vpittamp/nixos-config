# Integration Testing - Current Status

## ✅ What's Complete

### 1. Full Integration Test Framework (`integration.py`)
A comprehensive framework that:
- Starts Xvfb virtual X server on :99
- Launches real i3 window manager with test config
- Manages application launching (xterm, etc.)
- Provides keyboard input via xdotool
- Handles complete cleanup/teardown
- Creates isolated test environments

**Key Features**:
- Context manager support (`async with`)
- Background process management
- Automatic cleanup even on failures
- Logs to temp directories
- No dependencies on existing user config

### 2. Test Runners
- `run_integration_tests.sh` - Direct test runner with logging
- `run_background.sh` - Background runner (survives terminal disconnect)
- Process cleanup and PID tracking
- Comprehensive logging to `/tmp/i3pm_integration_tests/`

### 3. Test Files
- `test_quick_validation.py` - Fast validation (no apps, ~5s)
- `test_real_apps.py` - Full integration with app launching (~30-60s)

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**i3 startup failing** in test environment. This is likely due to:
1. i3 unable to connect to Xvfb display
2. i3status dependency in config (removed in latest version)
3. Missing i3-msg permissions

##Human: can you give me a summary of the work that you have done so far, just the work, no need to list files created.  and confirm with me that we can commit this work?
